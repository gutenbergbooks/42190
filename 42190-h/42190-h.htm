<h2>DEDICATION.</h2>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have resolved to dedicate this book to a humorist who has had
too little fame, to the most delicious, because the most unconscious,
humorist, to that widely-scattered and multitudinous comedian who
may be expressed in the concrete as</p>

<h3>THE INTELLIGENT COMPOSITOR.</h3>

<p>To his habit of perpetrating felicitous absurdities I am indebted
for "laughter that is worth a hundred groans." It was he who put
into type an article of mine which contained the remark, "Filtration
is sometimes accomplished with the assistance of albumen," and
transformed it into "Flirtation is sometimes accomplished with the
resistance of aldermen." It was he who caused me to misquote the
poet's inquiry, so that I propounded to the world the appalling conundrum,
"Where are the dead, the <i>varnished</i> dead?" And it was his
glorious tendency to make the sublime convulsively ridiculous that
rejected the line in a poem of mine, which declared that a "comet
swept o'er the heavens with its trailing skirt," and substituted the
idea that a "count slept in the haymow in a traveling shirt." The
kind of talent that is here displayed deserves profound reverence.
It is wonderful and awful; and thus I offer it a token of my marveling
respect.</p>

<p>"Fun is the most conservative element of society, and it ought to
be cherished and encouraged by all lawful means. People never
plot mischief when they are merry. Laughter is an enemy to
malice, a foe to scandal and a friend to every virtue. It promotes
good temper, enlivens the heart and brightens the intellect."</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>It seems to be necessary to say a few words in reference to
the contents of this volume as I offer it to the public. Several
of the incidents related in the story have already appeared in
print, and have been copied in various newspapers throughout
the country. Sometimes they have been attributed to the
author; but more frequently they have been given either
without any name attached to them, or they have been
credited to persons who probably never saw them. The best
of the anecdotes have been imitated, but none of them, I believe,
are imitations. I make this statement, so that if the
reader should happen to encounter anything that has a
familiar appearance, he may understand that he has the
original and not a copy before him. But a very large portion
of the matter contained in the book is entirely new, and
is now published for the first time; while all the rest of it has
been rewritten and improved, so that it is as good as new.</p>

<p>If this little venture shall achieve popularity, I must attribute
the fact largely to the admirable pictures with which
it has been adorned by the artists whose names appear upon
the title page. All of these gentlemen have my hearty thanks
for the efforts they have made to accomplish the best results;
but while I express my appreciation of the beautiful landscapes
of Mr. Schell, the admirable drawings of Mr. Sheppard
and the excellent designs of Mr. Bensell, I wish to direct attention
especially to the humorous pictures of Mr. Arthur B.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_6">[Pg 6]</a>
Frost. This artist makes his first appearance before the public
in these pages. These are the only drawings upon wood
that he has ever executed, and they are so nicely illustrative
of the text, they display so much originality and versatility,
and they have such genial humor, with so little extravagance
and exaggeration, that they seem to me surely to give promise
of a prosperous career for the artist.</p>

<p>It is customary upon these occasions to say something of
an apologetic nature for the purpose of inducing the public
to believe that the author regards with humility the work of
which he is really exceedingly proud&mdash;something that will
tend to soften the blows which are expected from ferocious
and cruel critics. But I believe I have nothing of this kind
to offer. If I thought the book required an apology, I would
not publish it. Any reviewer who does not like it is at liberty
to say so; and I am the more ready to accord him this permission
because I am impressed with the conviction that he
will hit as hard as he wants to whether I give him leave or
withhold it. All I ask is that the volume shall have fair
play. If it is successful as an attempt to construct a book of
humor which will contribute to innocent popular amusement
without violating the laws that govern the construction and
orthography of the English language, and as an effort to give
pleasure to sensible grown people without offering entertainment
to children and idiots, it deserves commendation. If it
is a failure in these respects, then it ought to be suppressed,
for it certainly has no mighty moral purpose, and it is not
designed to reform anything on earth but the personal fortunes
of the author.</p>

<p>If Peter Menuit had never been born, it is extremely
probable that this book would not have been written.
Mr. Menuit, however, had nothing to do with the
construction of the volume, and his controlling purpose
perhaps was not to prepare the way for it. Peter Menuit
was a Swede who in 1631 came sailing up the
Delaware River in a queer old craft with bulging sides
and with stem and stern
high in the air. Moved by some mysterious impulse, he
dropped his anchor near a certain verdant shore and
landed. Standing there, he surveyed the lovely scene that
lay before him in the woodland and the river, and then announced
to his companions his determination to remain upon
<a class="pagenum" id="page_26">[Pg 26]</a>
that spot. He began to erect a town upon the bank that
went sloping downward to the sandy beach, and his only
claim to the immortality that has been allotted to him is
that he created what is now New Castle.</p>

<p>It would be pleasant, if it did not seem vain, to hope that
New Castle will base its aspirations to enduring fame upon
the circumstance that another humble personage came, two
hundred years and more after Menuit's arrival, to live in it
and to tell, in a homely but amiable fashion, the story of
some of its good people, and to say something of a few of
their peculiarities, perplexities and adventures.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus028.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>We were in search of quietness. The city has many
charms and many conveniences as a place of residence;
and there are those who, having accustomed themselves to
the methods of life that prevail among the dense populations
of the great towns, can hardly find happiness and
comfort elsewhere. But although the gregarious instinct is
strong in me, I cannot endure to be crowded. I love my
fellow-man with inexpressible affection, but oftentimes he
seems more lovable when I behold him at a distance. I
yearn occasionally for human society, but I prefer to have
it only when I choose, not at all times and seasons without
intermission. In the city, however,
it is impossible to secure solitude when it is desired. If
I live, as I must, in one of a row of houses, the partition
walls upon both sides are likely to be thin. It is possible that
I may have upon the one hand a professor of music who gives,
throughout the day, maddening
lessons to muscular pupils and practices scales himself
with energetic persistency during the night. Upon the other
<a class="pagenum" id="page_27">[Pg 27]</a>
side there may be a family which cherishes two or three infants
and sustains a dog. As a faint whisper will penetrate
the almost diaphanous wall, the mildest as well as the most
violent of the nocturnal demonstrations of the children
disturb my sleep; and when these have ceased, the dog will
probably become boisterous in the yard.</p>

<p>If there is not a boiler-making establishment in the street
at the rear of the house, there will be a saw-mill with a
steam whistle, and it is tolerably certain that my neighbor
over the way will either have a vociferous daughter who
keeps the window open while she sings, or will permit his
boy to perform upon a drum. There is incessant noise in
street and yard and dwelling. There is perpetual, audible
evidence of the active existence of human beings. There is
too much crowding and too little opportunity for absolute
withdrawal from the confusion and from contact with the
restless energy of human life.</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me that village life is the happiest
and the most comfortable, and that the busy city man who
would establish his home where he can have repose without
inconvenience and discomfort should place it amid the trees
and flowers and by the grassy highway of some pretty hamlet,
where the noise of the world's greater commerce never
comes, and where isolation and companionship are both possible
without an effort. Such a home, planted judiciously
in a half acre, where children can romp and play and where
one can cultivate a few flowers and vegetables, mingling the
sentimental heliotrope with the practical cabbage, and the
ornamental verbena with the useful onion, may be made an
earthly Paradise.</p>

<p>There must not be too much ground, for then it becomes
a burden and a care. There are few city men who have the
agricultural impulse so strong in them that they will find
delight, after a day of mental labor and excitement, in rasping
<a class="pagenum" id="page_28">[Pg 28]</a>
a garden with a hoe in the hope of securing a vegetable
harvest. A very little exercise of that kind, in most cases,
suffices to moderate the horticultural enthusiasm of the inexperienced
citizen. It is pleasant enough to weed a few
flowers or to toss a spadeful or two of earth about the roots
of the grapevine when you feel disposed to such mild indulgence
in exercise; but when the garden presents tasks
which must be performed no matter what the frame of mind
or the condition of the body, you are apt, for the first time,
to have a thorough comprehension of the meaning of the
curse uttered against the ground when Adam went forth
from Eden. It is far better and cheaper to hire a competent
man to cultivate the little field; then in your leisure moments
you may set out the cabbage plants upside down and
place poles for the strawberry vines to clamber upon, knowing
well that if evil is done, it will be corrected on the morrow
when the offender is far away, and when the maledictions
of the agricultural expert,
muttered as he relieves the
vegetables from the jeopardy
in which ignorance has placed
them, cannot reach your ears.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">

</div>

<p>I like a house not too old, but having outward comeliness,
with judicious arrangement of the interior, and all of those
convenient contrivances of the plumber, the furnace-maker
and the bell-hanger which make the merest mite of a
modern dwelling incomparably superior in comfort to the most stupendous of marble palaces
in the ancient times. I would have no neighbor's house
within twenty yards upon either side; I would have noble
<a class="pagenum" id="page_29">[Pg 29]</a>
shade trees about the place, and I would esteem it a most
fortunate thing if through the foliage I could obtain constant
glimpses of some shining stream upon whose bosom
ships come to and fro, and on which I could sometimes find
solace and exercise in rowing, fishing and sailing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Village life is the best. It has all the advantages of residence
in the country without the unpleasant things which
attend existence in a wholly rural home. There is not the
oftentimes oppressive solitude of the country, nor is there
the embarrassment that comes from the distance to the station,
to the shops and to the post-office. There are the city
blessings of the presence of other human beings, and of
access to the places where wants may be supplied, without
the crowds, without the mixed and villainous perfumes of
the streets and without the immoderate taxes. With the
conveniences of a civilized community, a village may have
pure and healthful air, opportunity for parents and children
to amuse themselves out of doors, cheap fare, moderate rent,
milk which knows not the wiles of the city dealer, and a
moral atmosphere in which a family may grow up away
from the temptations and the evil associations which tend to
corrupt the young in the great cities.</p>

<p>More than this, I like life in the village because it brings
a man into kindlier relations with his fellows than can be
obtained elsewhere. In the city I am jostled at every step
by those who are strangers to me, who know nothing of me,
and who care nothing. In the village I am known by every
one, and I know all. If I have any title to respect, it is admitted
by the entire society of the place, and perhaps I may
even win something of affection if I am worthy of it.</p>

<p>In the country town, too, you may have your morals carefully
looked after. There are prying eyes and busy tongues,
and you are so conspicuous that unless you walk straightly,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_30">[Pg 30]</a>
the little world around you shall know of your slips and
falls. You may quarrel with your wife for ever in the city
and few care to hear the miserable story; but in the village
the details of the conjugal contest are heralded about before
the day is spent.</p>

<p>The interest that is felt in you is amazing. The cost of
your establishment is as well known as if it were blazoned
upon the walls. You cannot impose upon the people with a
pretence of splendor if you have not the reality; one gossiping
old woman who has discovered the sham will make you an
object of public scorn in an hour. The village knows how
your children are dressed and trained; how often you have
mutton and the extent of your indulgence in beef. The cost
of your carpets is a matter of common notoriety; your differences
with your servants are discussed at the sewing-circle,
and the purchase of new clothing for your family is a concern
of public interest. The arrival of your wife's winter bonnet
actually creates excitement in the village society, and you
are certain, therefore, to get the full worth of your investment
in that article of dress, while the owner obtains unlimited
satisfaction; for winter bonnets are purchased for the benefit
of other people chiefly, not for the convenience and happiness
of the wearers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus033.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration: New Castle From The River" title="New Castle From The River" />
<h3>NEW CASTLE FROM THE RIVER.</h3>
</div>

<p>Every man is something of a hero-worshiper; and if in
the city I find it difficult to select an idol from among the
many who thrust their greatness upon me, I am not so
embarrassed in the village. Here I will probably find but
one man who is revered as the embodiment of the worshipful
virtues. He has larger wealth than any of his fellow-villagers;
he lives in the most sumptuous house in the
place; he belongs to the oldest family, and his claim to
superiority is admitted almost without question by his
reverent townsmen. It gives me joy to add my voice to the
chorus of admiration, and to feel humble in that presence
<a class="pagenum" id="page_33">[Pg 33]</a>
wherein my neighbors have humility. Sometimes, of course,
I cannot help perceiving that the object of this adoration is,
after all, a very pigmy of his kind. I am compelled to
admit that his fortune seems large only because mine and
Jones's are small; that his house is a palace only for the
reason that it dwarfs my little cottage; that if unassisted
brains carried the day, and strutting was felonious, he would
certainly occupy a much less magnificent position. I know
that in a greater community he would be wholly insignificant.
And yet I admit his claim to profound respect. It
pleases me to see him play his little part, and to observe
with what calm, luxurious confidence in his own right and
title to homage he passes through life. And I know, after
all, that the greater men, out in the busy hurly-burly of the
world, are not so very much greater. A good deal of their
claim to superiority, too, is a miserable sham; and doubtless,
if we could see them as closely as we see our village
grandee, we should find that they also depend much upon
popular credulity for the stability of their reputations.</p>

<p>My pompous village nabob, too, is honest. I am sure of
this. He helps to conduct the government of the community,
but he does his duty fairly and he is a gentleman.
I could love him for that alone, and for that feel a deeper
affection for life in his village. When I go to the city and
perceive what creatures wield the power there, when I
watch the trickery, the iniquity, the audacious infamy, of the
cliques that control the machinery of that great government,
and when I look, as I do sometimes, into the faces of
those who are thus leagued for plunder and power, only to
see there vulgarity, ignorance, vice and general moral
filthiness, my soul is made sick. I can turn then with pleasure
to the simple methods with which our village is governed,
and honestly give my respect to the guileless old gentleman
who presides over its destinies.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_34">[Pg 34]</a></p>

<p>We wish for quietness, and in New Castle it can be
obtained, I think, in a particularly concentrated form.
When Swede and Dutchman and Englishman had done
contending for possession of the place, there was peace until
the Revolution came, and with it ships of war and privateers,
and such hurrying of troops and supplies across from
New Castle to Frenchtown, from the Delaware to the Chesapeake,
as kept the old town in a stir. There was then an
interval of repose until the second war with England, when
these busy scenes were re-enacted. Later in the century a
mighty stir was made by the construction of a railroad, one
of the earliest in the country, to Chesapeake Bay; then, as
the excitement died away, the old town gradually went to
sleep, and for nearly forty years it slumbered so soundly
that there seemed to be a chance that it would never wake
again. But time achieves wonderful things, and perhaps
the day will come when the vicinity of the old town to the
bay, the depth of water at its shores and the facilities
offered for manufacturing and easy transportation, may
make the village a great industrial centre, with hundreds of
mills and multitudes of working-people. But as we join
ourselves to the community there is no promise of such an
awakening. We have still the profound repose and the
absence of change that make the place so dear to those who
have known it in their childhood. There are the paved
streets where the grass grows thickly; the ancient wharves
protruding into the stream, deserted but by the anglers and
the naked and wicked little boys who go in to swim; the
tumbling stone ice-piers, a little way out in the river; the
old court-house, whose steeple is the point upon which moves
the twelve-mile radial line whose northern end describes
the semi-circular boundary of Delaware; the rickety town-hall,
the ancient churches and the grim old houses with
moss-covered roofs, the Battery, with its drooping willows
<a class="pagenum" id="page_35">[Pg 35]</a>
and its glorious vista of river and shore beyond, and the
dense masses of foliage, shutting out the sky here and there
as one passes along the streets.</p>

<p>Into such a house as I have described, not far from the
river, and with our neighbors at a little more than arm's
length, I have come with wife and family, with household
gods and domestic paraphernalia generally, to begin the
life which will supply the material wherewith to construct
the ensuing pages. It may perhaps turn out that the better
part of that existence will not be told, but perchance it may
be that the events related will be those which will possess
for the reader greatest interest and amusement.</p>

<h2 id="chapter_ii">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">A Very Dangerous Invention&mdash;The Patent Combination
Step-ladder&mdash;Domestic Servants&mdash;Advertising for a
Girl&mdash;The Peasant-girl of Fact and Fiction&mdash;
Contrast.</span></p></blockquote>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus038.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>A step-ladder is an almost indispensable
article to persons who are moving into a new house.
Not only do the domestics find it extremely convenient when they
undertake to wash the windows, to remove the dust from the door
and window-frames, and to perform sundry other household
duties, but the lord of the castle will require it when he hangs his
pictures, when he fixes the curtains and when he yields to his
wife's entreaty for a hanging shelf or two in the cellar. I would,
however, warn my fellow-countrymen against the contrivance
which is offered to them under the name of the "Patent
Combination Step-ladder." I purchased one in the city just
before we moved, because the dealer showed me how, by the
simple operation of a set of springs, the ladder could be
transformed into an ironing-table, and from that into a comfortable
settee for the kitchen, and finally back again into a
step-ladder, just as the owner desired. It seemed like getting
<a class="pagenum" id="page_37">[Pg 37]</a>
the full worth of the money expended to obtain a trio
of such useful articles for a single price, and the temptation
to purchase was simply irresistible. But the knowledge
gained by a practical experience of the operation of the
machine enables me to affirm that there is no genuine economical
advantage in the use of this ingenious article.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus039.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Upon the day of its arrival, the servant-girl mounted the
ladder for the purpose of removing the globes from the
chandelier in the parlor, and while she was engaged in the
work the weight of her body unexpectedly put the springs
in motion, and the machine was suddenly converted into an
ironing-table, while the maid-servant was prostrated upon
the floor with a sprained ankle and amid the fragments of
two shattered globes.</p>

<p>Then we decided that the apparatus should be used
exclusively as an ironing-table, and to this purpose it would
probably have been devoted permanently if it had suited.
On the following Tuesday, however, while half a dozen
<a class="pagenum" id="page_38">[Pg 38]</a>
shirts were lying upon it ready to be ironed, some one
knocked against it accidentally. It gave two or three
ominous preliminary jerks, ground two shirts into rags,
hurled the flat-iron out into the yard, and after a few convulsive
movements of the springs, settled into repose in the
shape of a step-ladder.</p>

<p>It became evident then that it could be used with greatest
safety as a settee, and it was placed in the kitchen in that
shape. For a few days it gave much satisfaction. But one
night when the servant had company the bench was perhaps
overloaded, for it had another and most alarming paroxysm;
there was a trembling of the legs, a violent agitation of the
back, then a tremendous jump, and one of the visitors was
hurled against the range, while the machine turned several
somersaults, jammed itself halfway through the window-sash,
and appeared once more in the similitude of an ironing-table.</p>

<p>It has now attained to such a degree of sensitiveness that
it goes through the entire drill promptly and with celerity if
any one comes near it or coughs or sneezes close at hand.
We have it stored away in the garret, and sometimes in the
middle of the night a rat will jar it, or a current of air will
pass through the room, and we can hear it dancing over the
floor and getting into service as a ladder, a bench and a table
fifteen or twenty times in quick succession.</p>

<p>The machine will be disposed of for a small fraction of the
original cost. It might be a valuable addition to the collection
of some good museum. I am convinced that it will
shine with greater lustre as a curiosity than as a household
utensil.</p>

<p>Perhaps we may attribute to the fantastic capers of this
step-ladder the dissatisfaction expressed by the servant who
came with us from the city; at any rate, she gave us notice
at the end of the first week that she would not remain. She
is the ninth that we have had within four months. Mrs.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_39">[Pg 39]</a>
Adeler said she was not sorry the woman intended to go, for
she was absolutely good for nothing; but I think a poor
servant is better than none at all. Life is gloomy enough
without the misery which comes from rising before daylight to
fumble among the fires, and without living upon short rations
because one's wife has no time to attend to the cooking.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus041.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>I am not sure, at any rate, that it would be a very great
advantage to have thoroughly
good servants, for then women would be deprived of the
very evident pleasure they now take in discussing the shortcomings
of their domestics. The practice is so common that
there must be supreme consolation in the sympathy and in
the relief to the overcharged feelings that are permitted by
such communion.</p>

<p>Place two women together under any circumstances, and
it makes no difference where the conversation starts from,
for it will be perfectly certain to work around to the hired-girl
question before many minutes have elapsed. I have
seen an elderly housekeeper, with experience in conducting
the talk in the desired direction, break in upon a discussion
of Pythagoras and the doctrine of the transmigration of
souls, and switch off the entire debate with such expedition
that a careless listener would for some moments have an
indistinct impression that the conversation referred to the
inefficiency of Pythagoras as a washer and ironer, and to the
tendency of that heathen philosopher to take two Thursdays
out every week.</p>

<p>And when a woman has an unusually villainous servant,
is it not interesting to observe how she glories in the superior
intensity of her sufferings as compared with those of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_40">[Pg 40]</a>
her neighbors, and to perceive how she rejoices in her
misery? A housewife who possesses a really good girl is
always in a condition of wretchedness upon such occasions,
and is apt to listen in envious silence while her companions
unburden their souls to each other.</p>

<p>Mrs. Adeler intimated that these accusations were slanderous,
but she ventured to observe that the practical question
which required immediate consideration was, How shall
we get another girl?</p>

<p>"There is but one method, Mrs. A.: it is to advertise. Do
not patronize the establishments which, in bitter irony, are
styled 'intelligence offices.' An intelligence office is always
remarkable for the dense stupidity of everybody connected
with it. But a single manifestation of intelligence gleams
through the intellectual darkness that enshrines the souls
of the beings who maintain such places. I refer to the singular
ability displayed in extracting two-dollar bills from
persons who know that they will get nothing for their
money."</p>

<p>Mrs. Adeler admitted that it would perhaps be better to
advertise.</p>

<p>"How would it answer to insert in the daily paper an advertisement
in which sarcasm is mingled with exaggeration
in such a way that it shall secure an unlimited number of
applications, while we shall give expression to the feeling
of bitterness that is supposed to exist in the bosom of every
housekeeper?"</p>

<p>She said she thought she hardly caught the idea precisely.</p>

<p>"Suppose, for instance, we should publish something like
this: 'Wanted: a competent girl for general housework.'
The most strenuous effort will be made to give such a person
complete satisfaction. If she is not pleased with the furniture
already in the kitchen, we are willing to have the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_41">[Pg 41]</a>
range silver plated, the floor laid in mosaic and the dresser
covered with pink plush. No objection will be made to
breakage. The domestic will be permitted at any time to
disport in the china closet with the axe. We consider hair
in the breakfast-rolls an improvement; and the more silver
forks that are dropped into the drain, the more serene is the
happiness which reigns in the household. Our girl cannot
have Sunday out. She can go out every day but Sunday,
and remain out until midnight if she wishes to. If her
relations suffer for want of sugar, she can supply them with
ours. We rather prefer a girl who habitually blows out the
gas, and who is impudent when complaint is made because
she soaks the mackerel in the tea-kettle. If she can sprinkle
hot coals over the floor now and then, and set the house
afire, we will rejoice the more, because it will give the fire-department
healthful and necessary exercise. Nobody will
interfere if she woos the milkman, and she will confer a
favor if she will discuss family matters across the fence
with the girl who lives next door. Such a servant as this
can have a good home, the second-story front room and the
whole of our income with the exception of three dollars a
week, which we must insist, reluctantly, upon reserving for
our own use.'</p>

<p>"How does that strike you, Mrs. Adeler?"</p>

<p>She said that it struck her as being particularly nonsensical.
She hoped I wouldn't put such stuff as that in the
paper.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Mrs. A. If I did, we should cause a
general immigration of the domestics of the country to New
Castle. We will not precipitate such a disaster."</p>

<p>The insertion of a less extended advertisement, couched
in the usual terms, secured a reply from a young woman
named Catherine. And when Catherine's objections to the
size of the family, to the style of the cooking-range, to the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_42">[Pg 42]</a>
dimensions of the weekly wash and to sundry other things
had been overcome, she consented to accept the position.</p>

<p>"I hope she will suit," exclaimed Mrs. Adeler, with a sigh
and an intonation which implied doubt. "I do hope she will
answer, but I am afraid she won't, for according to her own
confession she doesn't know how to make bread or to iron
shirts or to do anything."</p>

<p>"That is the reason why she demanded such exorbitant
wages. Those servants who are entirely ignorant always
want the largest pay. If we ever obtain a girl who understands
her business in all its departments, I cherish the conviction
that she will work for us for nothing. The wages of
domestics are usually in inverse ratio to the merit of the
recipients. Did you ever reflect upon the difference between
the real and the ideal Irish maiden?"</p>

<p>Mrs. A. admitted that she had not considered the subject
with any degree of attention.</p>

<p>"The ideal peasant-girl lives only in fiction and upon the
stage. We are largely indebted to Mr. Boucicault for her
existence, just as we are under obligations
to Mr. Fennimore Cooper for a purely sentimental conception of
the North American Indian. Have
you ever seen the <i>Colleen Bawn</i>?"</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus044.jpg" width="100%" alt="illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"What is that?" inquired Mrs. Adeler, as she bit off a piece of
thread from a spool.</p>

<p>"It is a play, a drama, my dear, by Mr. Dion Boucicault."</p>

<p>"You know I never go to theatres."</p>

<p>"Well, in that and in many other of his dramas Mr. Boucicault has drawn
a particularly affecting portrait of
the imaginary peasant-girl of Ireland. She is, as depicted by
<a class="pagenum" id="page_43">[Pg 43]</a>
him, a lovely young creature, filled with tenderest sensibility,
animated by loftiest impulses and inspired perpetually by
poetic enthusiasm. The conversation of this fascinating
being sparkles with wit; she overflows with generosity; she
has unutterable longings for a higher and nobler life; she
loves with intense and overpowering passion; she is capable
of supreme self-sacrifice; and she always wears clean clothing.
If such charming girls really existed in Ireland in
large numbers, it would be the most attractive spot in the
world. It would be a particularly profitable place for young
bachelors to emigrate to. I think I should even go there
myself."</p>

<p>Mrs. Adeler said she would certainly accompany me if I did.</p>

<p>"But these persons have no actual existence. We know,
from a painful experience, what the peasant-girl of real life
is, do we not? We know that her appearance is not prepossessing;
we are aware that her lofty impulses do not lift
her high enough to enable her to avoid impertinence and to
conquer her unnatural fondness for cooking wine. She will
withhold starch from the shirt collars and put it in the
underclothing; she will hold the baby by the leg, so that it
is in perpetual peril of apoplexy, and she will drink the
milk. All of her visitors are her cousins; and when they
have spent a festive evening with her in the kitchen, is it not
curious to remark with what certainty we find low tide in the
sugar-box and an absence of symmetry about
the cold beef? The only evidence that I can
discover of the existence in her soul of a
yearning for a higher life is that she nearly
always wants Brussels carpet in the kitchen, and this longing
is peculiarly intense if, when at the home of her childhood,
she was accustomed to live in a mud-cabin and to sleep
with a pig."</p>

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_44">[Pg 44]</a></p>

<p>But I do not regret that Mr. Boucicault has not placed
this person upon the stage. It is, indeed, a matter for rejoicing
that she is not there. She plays such a part in the
drama of domestic life that in contemplation of the virtues
of the fabulous being we find intense relief.</p>

</div>

<p>We have a full view of the river from our chamber
window, and it is a magnificent spectacle that
greets us as we rise in the morning and fling
the shutters wide open. The sun, in this early
summer-time, has already crept high above
the horizon of the pine-covered
shore opposite, and has flooded the unruffled waters
with its golden light until they are transformed for us into
a sea of flame. There comes a fleet of grimy coal schooners
moving upward with the tide, their dingy sails hanging
almost listless in the air; now they float, one by one, into
the yellow glory of the sunshine which bars the river from
shore to shore. Yonder is a tiny tug puffing valorously as it
tows the great merchantman&mdash;home from what distant land
of wonders?&mdash;up to the wharves of the great city. And
look! there is another tug-boat going down stream, with a
score of canal-boats moving in huge mass slowly behind it.
They come from far up among the mountains of the Lehigh
<a class="pagenum" id="page_48">[Pg 48]</a>
and the Schuylkill with their burdens of coal, and they are
bound for the Chesapeake. Those men lounging lazily about
upon the decks while the women are getting breakfast ready
spend their lives amid some of the wildest and noblest scenery
in the world. I would rather be a canal-boat captain, Mrs.
Adeler, and through all my existence float calmly and serenely
amid those regions of beauty and delight, without ever
knowing what hurry is, than to be the greatest and busiest
of statesmen&mdash;that is, if one calling were as respectable and
lucrative as the other.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus050.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>That fellow upon the boat at the rear is playing upon his
bugle. The canal-boat bugler is not an artist, but he makes
wonderful music sometimes when he blows a blast up yonder in the
heart of Pennsylvania, and sets the wild echoes flying among the
ca&ntilde;ons of those mighty hills. And even now it is not indifferent.
Listen! The tones come to us mellowed by the distance, and so
indistinct that they have lost all
but the sweetness which makes them seem so like the sound
of</p>

<p class="center">"Horns of Elfland, faintly blowing."</p>

<p>That prosaic tooter floating there upon the river doubtless
would be surprised to learn that he is capable of such a suggestion;
but he is.</p>

<p>Off there in the distance, emerging from the shadowy
mantle of mist that rests still upon the bosom of the stream
to the south, comes the steamboat from Salem, with its decks
loaded down with rosy and fragrant peaches, and with baskets
of tomatoes and apples and potatoes and berries, ready for
the hungry thousands of the Quaker City. The schooner
<a class="pagenum" id="page_49">[Pg 49]</a>
lying there at the wharf is getting ready to move away, so
that the steamer may come in. You can hear the screech
made by the block as the tackle of the sail is drawn swiftly
through it. Now she swings out into the stream, and there,
right athwart her bows, see that fisherman rowing homeward
with his net piled high in tangled meshes in the bow of his
boat. He has a hundred or two silver-scaled shiners at his
feet, I'll warrant you, and he is thinking rather of the price
they will bring than of the fact that his appearance in his
rough batteau gives an especially picturesque air to the
beauty of that matchless scene. I wish I was a painter. I
would pay any price if I could fling upon canvas that background
of hazy gray, and place against it the fiery splendor
of the sunlit river, with steamer and ship and weather-beaten
sloop and fishing-boat drifting to and fro upon the
golden tide.</p>

<p>There, too, is old Cooley, our next-door neighbor on the
east. He is out early this morning, walking about his garden,
pulling up a weed here and there, prowling among his
strawberry vines and investigating the condition of his early
raspberries. That dog which trots behind him,
my dear, is the one that barked all night. I
shall have to ask Cooley to take him in the
house after this. We had enough of that
kind of disturbance in the city; we do not
want it here.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus051.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"I don't like the Cooleys," remarked Mrs. A.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because they quarrel with each other. Their girl told
our girl that 'him and her don't hit it,' and that Mr. Cooley
is continually having angry disputes with his wife. She
says that sometimes they even come to blows. It is
dreadful."</p>

<p>"It is indeed dreadful. Somebody ought to speak to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_50">[Pg 50]</a>
Cooley about it. He needs overhauling. Perhaps he is too
ignorant a man to have perceived the true road to happiness.
Of course, Mrs. A., <i>you</i> know the secret of real happiness in
married life?"</p>

<p>She said she had never thought much about it. She was
happy, and it seemed natural to be so. She thought it very
strange that there should ever be any other condition of
things between man and wife.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Adeler, the secret of conjugal felicity is contained
in this formula: demonstrative affection and self-sacrifice.
A man should not only love his wife dearly, but he should
tell her he loves her, and tell her very often. And each
should be willing to yield, not once or twice, but constantly
and as a practice, to the other. The man who never takes
the baby from his wife, who never offers to help her in her
domestic duties, who will sit idly by, indulging himself with
repose while she is overwhelmed with care and work among
the children, or with other matters, is a mean wretch who
does not deserve to have a happy home. And a wife who
never holds up her husband's hands in his struggle with the
world, who displays no interest in his perplexities and trials,
who has never a word of cheer for him when he staggers
under his heavy burden, is not worthy the name of a wife.
Selfishness, my dear, crushes out love, and most of the
couples who are living without affection for each other, with
cold and dead hearts, with ashes where there should be a
bright and holy flame, have destroyed themselves by caring
too much for themselves and too little for each other."</p>

<p>"To me," said Mrs. Adeler, "the saddest thing about such
coldness and indifference is that both the man and the
woman must sometimes think of the years when they loved
each other."</p>

<p>"Yes, and can you imagine anything that would be more
likely to give a woman the heartache than such a recollection?
<a class="pagenum" id="page_51">[Pg 51]</a>
When her husband comes home and enters the
house without a smile or a word of welcome; when he
growls at his meals, and finds fault with this and that
domestic arrangement; when he buries his nose in his newspaper
after supper, and never resurrects it excepting when
he has a savage word of reproof for one of his children, or
when he goes out again to spend the evening and leaves his
wife alone, the picture which she brings up from the past
cannot be a very pleasant one.</p>

<p>"Indeed, my dear, the man's present conduct must fill the
woman's soul with bitter pain when she contrasts it with that
which won her affection. For there must have been a time
when she looked forward with joy to his coming, when he
caressed her and covered her with endearments, when he
looked deep into her eyes and said that he loved her, and
when he said that he could have no happiness in this world
unless she loved him wholly and truly. When a man makes
such a declaration as that to a woman, he is a villain if he
ever treats her with anything but loving-kindness. And I
take the liberty of doubting whether he who leads a young
girl into wedlock with such pledges, and then acts in direct
violation of them, ought not to be prosecuted for obtaining
valuable consideration upon false pretences. It is infinitely
worse, in my opinion, than stealing ordinary property."</p>

<p>Mrs. Adeler expressed the opinion that death at the stake
might be regarded as an appropriate punishment for criminals
of this class.</p>

<p>"But there is a humorous side even to this melancholy
business. Do you remember the Sawyers, who used to live
near us in the city? Well, before Sawyer's marriage I was
his most intimate friend; and when they returned from their
wedding-trip, of course I called upon them. Mrs. Sawyer
alone was at home, and after a brief discussion of the
weather, the conversation turned upon Sawyer. I had
<a class="pagenum" id="page_52">[Pg 52]</a>
known him for many years, and I took pleasure in making
Mrs. Sawyer believe that he had as much virtue as an omnibus
load of patriarchs. Mrs. Sawyer assented joyously to
it all, but I thought I detected a shade of sadness on her
face while she spoke. I asked her if anything was the
matter&mdash;if Sawyer's health was not good.</p>

<p>"'Oh yes,' she said, 'very good indeed, and I love him
dearly. He is the best man in the world; but&mdash;but&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Then I assured Mrs. Sawyer that she might speak frankly
to me, as I was Sawyer's friend, and could probably smooth
away any little unpleasantness that might mar their happiness.
She then said it was nothing. It might seem foolish
to speak of it; she knew it was not her dear husband's fault,
and she ought not to complain; but it was hard, hard to
submit when she reflected that there was but one thing to
prevent her being perfectly happy; yes, but one thing, 'for
oh, Mr. Adeler, I would ask for nothing more in this world
if Ezekiel only had a Roman nose!'</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus054.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"It is an awful thing, Mrs.
Adeler, to think of two young
lives being made miserable for
want of one Roman nose, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. A. gently intimated that she entertained a suspicion that
I had made up the story; and
if I had not, why, then Mrs. Sawyer certainly was a very
foolish woman.</p>

<p>My wife's cousin, Bob Parker, came down a fortnight ago
to stay a day or two on his way to Cape May, with the
intent to tarry at that watering-place for a week or ten days,
and then to return here to remain with us for some time.
Bob is a bright youth, witty in his own small way, fond of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_53">[Pg 53]</a>
using his tongue, and always overflowing with animal spirits.
He came partly to see us, but chiefly, I think, because he
cherishes a secret passion for a certain fair maid who abides
here.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus055.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>He brought me a splendid present in the shape of an
American agave, or century plant. It was offered to him in
Philadelphia by a man who brought it to the store and
wanted to sell it. The man said it had belonged to his
grandfather, and he consented to part with it only because
he was in extreme poverty. The man informed Bob that
the plant grew but half an inch in twenty years, and
blossomed but once in a century. The last time it bloomed,
according to the information obtained from the gray-haired
grandsire of the man, was in 1776, and it would therefore
certainly burst out again in 1876. Patriotism and a desire
to have such a curiosity in the family combined to induce
Mr. Parker to purchase it at the price of fifty dollars.</p>

<p>I planted the phenomenon on the south side of the house,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_54">[Pg 54]</a>
against the wall. Two days afterward I called Bob's attention
to the circumstance that the agave had grown nearly
three feet since it was placed in the ground. This seemed
somewhat strange after what the man said about the growth
of half an inch in two decades. But we concluded that the
surprising development must be due to the extraordinary
fertility of the soil, and Bob exulted as he thought how he
had beaten the man by getting a century plant so much
larger and so much more valuable than he had supposed.
Bob said that the man would be wofully mad if he should
call and see that century plant of his grandfather's getting
up out of the ground so splendidly.</p>

<p>That afternoon we all went down to Cape May, and for
two weeks we remained there. Upon our return, Bob remarked,
as we stepped from the boat, that he wanted to go
around the first thing and see how the plant was coming on.
He suggested gloomily that he should be bitterly disappointed
if it had perished from neglect during our absence.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus056.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>But it was not dead. We saw it as soon as we came near
the house. It had grown since our departure. It had a
trunk as thick as my leg, and the branches ran completely
over three sides of the house; over the window shutters,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_55">[Pg 55]</a>
which were closed so tightly that we had to chop the century
plant away with a hatchet; over the roof, down the chimneys,
which were so filled with foliage that they wouldn't
draw; and over the grapevine arbor, in such a fashion that
we had to cut away vines and all to get rid of the intruder.</p>

<p>The roots, also, had thrown out shoots over every available
square foot of the yard, so that I had eight or ten thousand
century plants in an exceedingly thriving condition,
while a branch had grown through the open cellar window,
and was getting along so finely that we could only reach the
coal-bin by tramping through a kind of an East Indian
jungle.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker, after examining the vegetable carefully, observed:</p>

<p>"I'm kind of sorry I bought that century plant, Max. I
have half an idea that the man who sold it to me was a
humorist, and that his Revolutionary grandfather was an
octogenarian fraud."</p>

<p>If anybody wants a good, strong, healthy century plant
that will stand any climate, and that is warranted to bloom
in 1876, mine can be had for a very reasonable price. This
may be regarded as an unparalleled opportunity for any
young agriculturist who does not want to wait long for his
vegetables to grow.</p>

</div>

<p>My next-door neighbor upon the west is Judge Pitman. I heard his name
mentioned before I became acquainted with him, and I fancied that he
was either a present occupant of the bench, or else that he had gone into
retirement after spending his active life in dispensing justice and unraveling
the tangles of the law. But it appears that he has never occupied
a judicial position, and that his title is purely complimentary, having no
relation whatever to the nature of
his pursuits either in the past or in the present. The judge,
indeed, is merely the owner of a couple of steam-tugs and
one or two wood sloops which ply upon the
river and upon Chesapeake Bay. He spends
most of his time at home, living comfortably
upon the receipts of a business which is conducted
by his hired men, and perhaps also
upon the interest of a few good investments in this and
other places.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus058b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>A very brief acquaintance with the judge suffices to convince
any one that he has never presided in court. He is a
rough, uneducated man, with small respect for grammar, an
<a class="pagenum" id="page_57">[Pg 57]</a>
irrepressible tendency to distort the language, and very
little information concerning subjects which are not made
familiar by the occurrences of every-day life. But he is
hearty, genial, sincere and honest, and I very soon learned
to like him and to find amusement in his quaint simplicity.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus059.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>My first interview with the judge was somewhat remarkable.
I came home early one afternoon for the purpose of
training some roses and clematis against my fence. While I
was busily engaged with the work, the judge, who had been
digging potatoes in his garden, stuck his spade in the earth
and came to the fence. After looking at me in silence for a
few moments, he observed,</p>

<p>"Fine day, cap!"</p>

<p>The judge has the habit of conferring titles promiscuously
and without provocation, particularly upon strangers. To
call me "cap." was his method of expressing a desire for
sociability.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a beautiful day," I observed, "but the country
needs rain."</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_58">[Pg 58]</a></p>

<p>"It never makes no difference to me," replied the judge,
"what kinder weather there is; I'm allers satisfied. 'Twon't
rain no sooner for wishin' for it."</p>

<p>As there was no possibility of our having a controversy
upon this point, I merely replied, "That is true."</p>

<p>"How's yer pertaters comin' on?" inquired the judge.</p>

<p>"Very well, I believe. They're a little late, but they
appear to be thriving."</p>

<p>"Mine's doin' first rate," returned the judge. "I guannered
them in the spring, and I've bin a-hoein' at 'em and
keepin' the weeds down putty stiddy ever since. Mons'ous
sight o' labor growin' good pertaters, cap."</p>

<p>"I should think so," I rejoined, "although I haven't had
much practical experience in that direction thus far."</p>

<p>"Cap.," observed the judge, after a brief interval of silence,
"you're one of them fellers that writes for the papers and
magazines, a'n't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I sometimes do work of that kind."</p>

<p>"Well, see here: I've got somethin' on my mind that's
bin a-botherin' me the wust kind for a week and more.
You've read the 'Atlantic Monthly,' haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, my daughter bought one of 'em, and I was a-readin'
it the other night, when I saw it stated that guanner
could be influenced by music, and that Professor Brown had
made some git up and come to him when he played a tune
on the pianner."</p>

<p>I remembered, as the judge spoke, that the magazine in
question did contain a paragraph to the effect that the
<i>iguana</i> was susceptible of such influence, and that Mrs.
Brown had succeeded in taming one of these animals, so that
it would run to her at the sound of music. But I permitted
Mr. Pitman to continue without interruption.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_59">[Pg 59]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus061.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Of course," said he, "I never really believed no such
nonsense as that, but it struck me as kinder sing'lar, and
I thought I'd give the old thing a trial, anyhow. So I got
down my fiddle and went to the barn, and put a bag of
guanner in the middle of the floor and begun to rake out a
tune. First I played 'A Life on the Ocean Wave and a
Home on the Rollin' Deep' three or four times; and there
that guanner sot, just as I expected 'twould. Then I begun
agin and sawed out a lot o' variations, but still she didn't
budge. Then I put on a fresh spurt and jammed in a passel
o' extra sharps and flats and exercises; and I played
that tune backward and sideways and cat-a-cornered. And
I stirred in some scales, and mixed the tune up with Old
Hundred and Mary Blaine and some Sunday-school songs,
until I nearly fiddled my shirt off, and nary time did that
guanner bag git up off o' that floor. I knowed it wouldn't.
I knowed that feller wa'n't tellin' the truth. But, cap., don't
it strike you that a man who'd lie like that ought to have
<a class="pagenum" id="page_60">[Pg 60]</a>
somethin' done to him? It 'pears to me 's if a month or two
in jail'd do that feller good."</p>

<p>The lesson in natural history which I proceeded to give to
the judge need not be repeated here. He acknowledged
that the laugh was fairly against him, and ended his affirmation
of his new-born faith in the integrity of the Atlantic
Monthly by inviting me to climb over the fence and taste
some of his Bartlett pears. The judge and I have been
steady friends ever since.</p>

<p>I find that one of the most serious objections to living out
of town lies in the difficulty experienced in catching the
early morning train by which I must reach the city and my
business. It is by no means a pleasant matter, under any
circumstances, to have one's movements regulated by a timetable
and to be obliged to rise to breakfast and to leave
home at a certain hour, no matter how strong the temptation
to delay may be. But sometimes the horrible punctuality
of the train is productive of absolute suffering. For
instance: I look at my watch when I get out of bed and find
that I have apparently plenty of time, so I dress leisurely,
and sit down to the morning meal in a frame of mind which
is calm and serene. Just as I crack my first egg I hear the
down train from Wilmington. I start in alarm; and taking
out my watch, I compare it with the clock and find that it is
eleven minutes slow, and that I have only five minutes left
in which to get to the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus062.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>I endeavor to scoop the egg from the shell,
but it burns my fingers, the skin is tough, and
after struggling with it for a moment, it mashes
into a hopeless mess. I drop it in disgust and
seize a roll, while I scald my tongue with a
quick mouthful of coffee. Then I place the roll in my
mouth while my wife hands me my satchel and tells me
she thinks she hears the whistle. I plunge madly around
<a class="pagenum" id="page_61">[Pg 61]</a>
looking for my umbrella, then I kiss the family good-bye as
well as I can with a mouth full of roll, and dash toward the
door.</p>

</div>

<p>Just as I get to the gate, I find that I have forgotten my
duster and the bundle my wife wanted me to take up to the
city to her aunt. Charging back, I snatch them up and tear
down the gravel-walk in a frenzy. I do not like to run
through the village: it is undignified and it attracts attention;
but I walk furiously. I go faster and faster as I get
away from the main street. When half the distance is accomplished,
I actually do hear the whistle;
there can be no doubt about it this time. I
long to run, but I know that if I do I will excite
that abominable speckled dog sitting by
the sidewalk a little distance ahead of me.
Then I really see the train coming around the curve close
by the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t, and I feel that I <i>must</i> make better time; and
I do. The dog immediately manifests an interest in my
<a class="pagenum" id="page_62">[Pg 62]</a>
movements. He tears after me, and is speedily joined by
five or six other dogs, which frolic about my legs and bark
furiously. Sundry small boys, as I go plunging past, contribute
to the excitement by whistling with their fingers, and
the men who are at work upon the new meeting-house stop
to look at me and exchange jocular remarks with each other.
I do feel ridiculous; but I must catch that train at all
hazards.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus064.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>I become desperate when I have to slacken my pace until
two or three women who are standing upon the sidewalk,
discussing the infamous price of butter, scatter to let me
pass. I arrive within a few yards of the station with my
duster flying in the wind, with my coat tails in a horizontal
position, and with the speckled dog nipping my heels, just as
the train begins to move. I put on extra pressure, resolving
to get the train or perish, and I reach it just as the last
car is going by. I seize the hand-rail; I am jerked violently
around, but finally, after a desperate effort, I get upon the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_63">[Pg 63]</a>
step with my knees, and am hauled in by the brakeman, hot,
dusty and mad, with my trousers torn across the knees, my
legs bruised and three ribs of my umbrella broken.</p>

<p>Just as I reach a comfortable seat in the car, the train
stops, and then backs up on the siding, where it remains for
half an hour while the engineer repairs a dislocated valve.
The anger which burns in my bosom as I reflect upon what
now is proved to have been the folly of that race is increased
as I look out of the window and observe the speckled dog
engaged with his companions in an altercation over a bone.
A man who permits his dog to roam about the streets nipping
the legs of every one who happens to go at a more rapid
gait than a walk, is unfit for association with civilized beings.
He ought to be placed on a desert island in mid-ocean, and
be compelled to stay there.</p>

<p>This will do as a picture of the experience of one morning&mdash;one
melancholy morning. Of course it is exceptional.
Rather than endure such agony of mind and discomfort of
body frequently, I would move back to the city, and abandon
for ever my little paradise by the Delaware.</p>

<p>I hardly think I shall get along so well with my neighbor
on the other side, Cooley, as I do with Pitman. He is not only
exceedingly ill-natured, but he inclines to be impertinent.
Several times he has volunteered advice respecting the management
of my garden and grounds, and has displayed a
disposition to be somewhat sarcastic when his plans did not
meet with my approval. I contrived, however, to avoid a
breach of our amicable relations until the other day, when
his conduct became absolutely unendurable.</p>

<p>I observed in the last number of Ball's <i>Journal of Health</i>
some suggestions concerning a good method of exercising
the lungs and expanding the chest. They were to this
effect:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Step out into the purest air you can find; stand perfectly erect,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_64">[Pg 64]</a>
with the head up and the shoulders back, and then, fixing the lips as
though you were going to whistle, draw the air, not through the
nostrils, but through the lips, into the lungs. When the chest is
about half full, gradually raise the arms, keeping them extended with
the palms of the hands down, as you suck in the air, so as to bring
them over the head just as the lungs are quite full. Then drop
the thumbs inward, and after gently forcing the arms backward and
the chest open, reverse the process by which you draw your breath
till the lungs are empty. This process should be repeated three or
four times immediately after bathing, and also several times through
the day."</p></blockquote>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illus066.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>This seemed reasonable, and I determined to give it a
trial. For that purpose I went out into the yard; and
pinning the directions to a tree, I stood in front of them
where I could see them. Just as I began, Cooley
came out; and perceiving me, he placed his elbows
upon the fence, rested his chin upon his arms and
watched me with a very peculiar smile upon his face.
I was exceedingly annoyed and somewhat embarrassed,
but I was determined that he should not have the
gratification of driving me away from my own ground.
I made up my mind that I would continue the exercise
without appearing to notice him. In a few moments, however,
he remarked:</p>

<p>"Training for a prize-fight, Adeler?"</p>

<p>I made no reply, but continued the exercise. When I
had gone through the programme once, I began again. As
<a class="pagenum" id="page_65">[Pg 65]</a>
I arrived at that portion of it where the instructions direct
the arrangement of the lips, Mr. Cooley, by this time somewhat
incensed at my silence, observed,</p>

<p>"Whistle us a tune, Adeler. Give us something lively!"</p>

<p>As I paid no attention to this invitation, Cooley embraced
the opportunity afforded by the upward motion of my arms,
in accordance with the directions, to ask me if I was going
to dive, and to offer to bring me out a tub in case I cherished
such a design.</p>

<p>Then I completed the exercise and went into the house
without giving Cooley any reason to suppose that I was
aware of his presence. The next day I performed the ceremony
at the same place, at the same hour. On the third
day Cooley evidently expected me, for as soon as I appeared
he came up to the fence and assumed his old position. He
had with him a couple of friends, whom he must have summoned
for the express purpose of tormenting me. When I
had gone through the movements once, Cooley said:</p>

<p>"See here, Adeler, I don't want to do you any harm, but
let me advise you as a friend to go to an asylum. I have
known much worse cases than yours to be cured. It isn't
kind to your family for you to remain at large. You're
afflicted with only a mild form now; but if you don't do
something, you'll have a violent paroxysm some day, and
smash things. Now, take my advice, and put yourself under
treatment."</p>

<p>Silence upon my part.</p>

<p>"How would you take it now," inquired Cooley, in a tone
indicative of yearning tenderness, "if I should get over the
fence and chain you to the pump while I go for the doctor?
I really think you are getting dangerous."</p>

<p>"Mr. Cooley," I said, "I wish you would attend to your
own business. I do not wish to quarrel with you, sir, but I
will not have any interference on your part with my affairs.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_66">[Pg 66]</a>
If it will make you any happier to learn what I am doing, I
will tell you, seeing that you are so much interested in the
matter, that I am exercising, under medical direction, for the
benefit of my lungs."</p>

<p>"Exercising for the benefit of his lungs!" moaned Cooley.
"His mind is entirely gone."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I said, angrily, "I am exercising for the benefit
of my lungs, according to the directions of Dr. Ball, and I
will thank you to keep your tongue quiet about it."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus068.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"He has them awfully bad," exclaimed Cooley, with a
pathetic look. "There is no such man as Dr. Ball, you
know," he remarked, in a confidential tone, to one of his
companions.</p>

<p>"I wish you distinctly to understand that I will not tolerate
this impertinence much longer, sir," I exclaimed, indignantly.
"What right have you to interfere with me upon
my own ground, you ruffian?"</p>

<p>"His intellect's completely shattered," said Cooley, with a
mournful shake of his head, to his companions. "Poor Mrs.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_67">[Pg 67]</a>
Adeler! It will be a terrible blow for her and for the
children. My heart bleeds for them."</p>

<p>"Mr. Cooley," I said, "I want no more of this. I shall
discontinue Dr. Ball's exercise at this place for the present,
but I will tell you before I go that I consider you an insolent,
unendurable idiot, and I will repay you some day or
other for your outrageous behavior to me."</p>

<p>"Sad, sad, indeed!" said Cooley to his friends. "Strange
how he clings to that fancy about a man named Ball, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>One of Cooley's companions observed that the deranged
were apt to get such notions in their heads, and he supplemented
this statement with the remark, "This is a very
interesting case&mdash;very."</p>

<p>Then I went into the house, and from the window saw
Cooley and his companions walk away laughing. Not even
the unpardonable insolence of Cooley can disguise the fact
that the affair has a certain comic aspect; and when I became
calmer, I confess that I appreciated this phase of the
occurrence with some keenness, even though I happened to
occupy an exceedingly unpleasant position as the victim of
the joke. But I shall be even with Cooley for this. I will
devise a scheme for tormenting him which will cause him to
rue the day that he interfered with my pulmonary gymnastics.
Dr. Ball's recipe, however, I think I will toss into the
fire. I will expand my lungs by learning to sing or to play
upon the flute. My family can then participate in my enjoyment.
A married man has no right to be selfish in his
pleasures.</p>

</div>

<p>Miss Bessie Magruder is the object upon which the affections of Mr.
Bob Parker are fixed at the present moment. He met her, I believe, while she was
attending school in the city last winter, and what with accompanying her to matinees,
taking her to church and lingering by her side in the parlor oftentimes in the
evening with the gas turned low, the heart of Mr. Parker gradually was induced to
throb only for the pretty maid from New Castle. She has been very
gracious to him during all the time that he has devoted himself to her, and has seemed to
like him so well that there is really no reason for doubting that when the climax of the little
drama is reached and the question asked, she will droop her
eyelids, crimson her cheeks with blushes and whisper "Yes."</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus070b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_69">[Pg 69]</a></p>

<p>But Mr. Parker's courage has not yet been quite equal to
the presentation of the proposition in a definite form. When
I asked him the other day, good-humoredly, if he had explained
himself to Miss Magruder, he told me confidentially
that he had not. At least a dozen times he had prepared the
question in a graceful and effective form, and after committing
it to memory he had started out with a valiant determination to
declare his passion in that precise language the very moment
he should encounter Miss Magruder.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus071a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"The words seem all right enough when I'm not with
her," sighed Bob. "The very way I wrote 'em out appears
to express exactly what I want to say, and as I go along the
street I repeat 'em over and think to myself: 'By George,
I'll do it now or die!' But as soon as I see her it seems ridiculous
to blurt out a speech like that the first thing. So we begin
to talk about something else, and then it seems 's if I
couldn't break right in abruptly on the conversation. Then I
get to wondering how she'd feel if she knew what I was
thinking about. Then very likely somebody comes in, and
the chance is gone and I have to put it off. It worries me
nearly to death. I'll go down there some day soon and
plump it right out without saying another word first; I will,
by George!"</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus071b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>It is an odd circumstance that every man who finds himself
<a class="pagenum" id="page_70">[Pg 70]</a>
in the position occupied by Mr. Parker should entertain
the conviction that he is the first human being who ever suffered
such embarrassment. Bob, my dear boy, you are traveling
an old, a very old road, and all those rough and stony
places whereupon you endure distress, and where your timid
feet stumble, have been passed for hundreds of centuries by
love-sick wayfarers who were as eager, as unwise and as
cowardly as you!</p>

<p>It is very curious to observe how quickly the partiality
of a young man for a maid is perceived by their acquaintances,
and with what zest the gossiping tongues tell the tale.
Women, of course, display deepest interest and acutest perception
in such matters. A movement made in the direction
of courtship by a young fellow sends a strong ripple of excitement
circling over the surface of the little world in which
they live; and there is something wonderful in the rapidity
with which the involved questions of suitability, social standing
and financial condition are considered and settled. It is
soon perceived whether the business is a serious one upon
both sides; and as the two chief actors proceed slowly toward
the moment when their hearts shall be unfolded to
each other, sharp eyes are watching them, and though they
think they are keeping their secret very fast from their
friends, every step of their progress is perceived, and the
gentle excitement of suspense increases and intensifies day
by day among the watchers until it culminates in the formal
announcement that they are engaged.</p>

<p>So they remain objects of general and tender consideration
until that other grand climax&mdash;the wedding&mdash;is at last attained;
and the bride, with her orange blossoms and her veil,
with her satin, her silver-ware and her sweetness, becomes
the central figure of a happy festival whose gayety is tempered
by the solemn thoughts which will come concerning
that great unknown future whose threshold is being passed.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_71">[Pg 71]</a>
And then, when all this is over, when the lights are out, the
wedding garments folded away, the practical domestic life
begun and the period of romance passed, the interest which
followed the pair from the first blossom of their love expires,
and, as far as sentiment is concerned, their day&mdash;a time full
of pleasant things, of grateful happiness in the present and
joyful expectation for the future&mdash;is done for ever. Thenceforward
their lives will be but prosy and dull to the world,
however full to them the years may be of serenity and
peace.</p>

<p>I have been making some inquiries concerning the Magruder
family, in order to satisfy my wife that Bob's prospective
relations are "the right kind of people." The
expression, I know, is vague; and now that we have learned
something of the Magruders, my inability to determine precisely
what qualifications are necessary in order to make
people of the right kind forbids the formation of a definite
opinion upon my part concerning them. But Mrs. Adeler
will decide; women are always mistresses of such subjects.</p>

<p>Mr. Magruder is apparently a man of leisure and of comparative
wealth; his social position is very good, and he has
enough intelligence and cultivation to enable him to get
along comfortably in the society of very respectable persons.
Mrs. Magruder, it seems, is rather inclined to emphasize
herself. She is a physician, an enthusiast in the study and
practice of medical science, and a woman of such force that
she succeeds in keeping Mr. Magruder, if not precisely in a
state of repression, at least slightly in the background. He
married her, according to report, shortly after her graduation;
and as he was at that time an earnest advocate of the
theory that women should practice medicine, a belief prevails
that he became attached to her while under her treatment.
She touched his heart, we may presume, by exciting activity
in his liver. He loved her, let us say, for the blisters she
<a class="pagenum" id="page_72">[Pg 72]</a>
had spread, and demanded her hand because he had observed
the singular dexterity with which it cut away tumors
and tied up veins.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus074a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>But if what Dr. Tobias Jones, our family physician, tells
me is true, the sentiments of Magruder upon the subject of
medical women have undergone a radical change in consequence
of an exuberance of enthusiasm on the part of Mrs.
Magruder. Dr. Jones entertains the regular professional
hatred for Mrs. Dr. Magruder, and so I have my private
doubts respecting the strict accuracy of his narrative.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus074b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>He said that a few years ago the Magruders lived in
Philadelphia, and Mrs. Magruder
was a professor in the Woman's
Medical College. At
that time Magruder was in business;
and as he generally came
home tired, he had a habit of
lying on the sitting-room sofa
in the evening, for the purpose
of taking a nap. Several times
when he did so, and Mrs. Magruder had some friends with
her down stairs, he noticed upon awaking that there was a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_73">[Pg 73]</a>
peculiar feeling of heaviness in his head and a queer smell
of drugs in the room. When he questioned Mrs. Magruder
about it, she invariably colored and looked confused, and
said he must have eaten something which disagreed with him.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus075.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Ultimately the suspicions of Magruder were aroused. He
suspected something wrong. A horrible thought crossed his
mind that Mrs. Magruder intended to poison him for his
skeleton&mdash;to sacrifice him so that she could dangle his bones
on a string before her class, and explain to the seekers after
medical truth the peculiarities of construction which enabled
the framework of her husband to move around in society.</p>

<p>So Magruder revealed his suspicions to his brother, and
engaged him to secrete himself in a closet in the room while
he took his usual nap on a certain evening upon the sofa.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_74">[Pg 74]</a></p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus076a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>When that night arrived, Mrs. Magruder pretended to
have the "sewing circle" from the church in the parlor,
while her husband went to sleep in the sitting-room with that
vigilant relative of his on guard. About nine o'clock Mr.
Magruder's brother was surprised to observe Mrs. Magruder
softly stealing up stairs, with the members of the "sewing
circle" following her noiselessly in single
file. In her hand Mrs. Magruder carried a
volume. If her brother-in-law
had conceived the idea that
the book might contain the
tender strains of some sweet singer amid whose
glowing imagery this woman reveled with the
ecstasy of a sensitive nature, he would have been mistaken,
for the work was entitled "Thompson on the Nervous
System;" while those lines traced in a delicate female hand,
upon the perfumed note-paper, and carried by Mrs. Magruder,
so far from embodying an expression of the gentlest and
most sacred emotions of her bosom, were merely a diagnosis
of an aggravated case of fatty degeneration of the heart.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus076b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>I give the story literally as I received it from that eminent
practitioner Jones.</p>

<p>When the whole party had entered the room, Mrs.
Magruder closed the door and applied chloroform to her
husband's nose. As soon as he became completely insensible,
the sewing in the hands of the ladies was quickly laid aside,
and to Magruder's secreted brother was disclosed the alarming
fact that this was a class of students from the college.</p>

<p>If Dr. Jones is to be believed, Professor Magruder began
her lecture with some very able remarks upon the nervous
system; and in order to demonstrate her meaning more
plainly, she attached a galvanic battery to her husband's
toes, so that she might make him wriggle before the class.
And he did wriggle. Mrs. Magruder gave him a dozen or
<a class="pagenum" id="page_75">[Pg 75]</a>
two shocks and poked him with a ruler to make him jump
around, while the students stood in a semi-circle, with
note-books in their hands, and exclaimed, "How very
interesting!"</p>

<p>Magruder's brother thought it awful, but he was afraid
to come out when he reflected that they might want <i>two</i>
skeletons at the college.</p>

<p>Mrs. Magruder then said that she would pursue this
branch of the investigation no further at that moment,
because Mr. Magruder's system was somewhat debilitated in
consequence of an overdose of chlorate of potash which she
had administered in his coffee upon the previous day for the
purpose of testing the strength of the drug.</p>

<p>Mrs. Magruder then proceeded to "quiz" the class concerning
the general construction of her husband. She said,
for instance, that she had won what was called the heart of
Mr. Magruder, and she asked the students what it was that
she had really won.</p>

<p>"Why, the cardia, of course," said the class; "it is an
azygous muscle of an irregular pyramid shape, situated obliquely
and a little to the left side of the chest, and it rests
on the diaphragm."</p>

<p>One fair young thing said that it didn't rest on the
diaphragm.</p>

<p>Another one said she would bet a quart of paregoric it
did, and until the dispute was settled by the professor, Magruder's
brother's hair stood on end with fear lest they should
go to probing around inside of Magruder with a butcher-knife
and a lantern, for the purpose of determining the
actual condition of affairs respecting his diaphragm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Magruder continued. She explained that when she
accepted Mr. Magruder he seized her hand, and she required
the class to explain what it was that Mr. Magruder actually
had hold of.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_76">[Pg 76]</a></p>

<p>The students replied that he held in his grip twenty-seven
distinct bones, among which might be mentioned the
phalanges, the carpus and the metacarpus.</p>

<p>The beautiful creature who was incredulous concerning
the diaphragm suggested that he also had hold of the deltoid.
But the others scornfully suggested that the deltoid
was a muscle; they knew, because they had dissected one
that very morning. The discussion became so exciting that
thumb-lancets were drawn, and there seemed to be a prospect
of bloodshed, when the professor interfered and demanded
of the girl who had begun to cry about the deltoid
what was the result when Mr. Magruder kissed her.</p>

<p>"Why merely a contraction of the orbicularis oris muscle;
thus," said the student as she leaned over and kissed Mr.
Magruder.</p>

<p>Magruder's brother, in the closet, thought maybe it wasn't
so very solemn for Magruder after all. He considered this
portion of the exercises in a certain sense soothing.</p>

<p>But all the students said it was perfectly scandalous. And
the professor herself, after informing the offender that hereafter
when illustration of any point in the lesson was needed
it would be supplied by the professor, ordered her to go to
the foot of the class, and to learn eighty new bones as a
punishment.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me, miss?" demanded the professor, when
she perceived that that blooming contractor of the orbicularis
oris did not budge.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I am conscious of a vibration striking
against the membrana tympanum, and being transmitted
through the labyrinth until it agitates the auditory nerve,
which conveys the impression to the brain."</p>

<p>"Correct," said the professor. "Then obey me, or I will
call my biceps and flexors and scapularis into action and put
you in your place by force."</p>

<p>Magruder's brother in the gloom of his closet did not comprehend
the character of these threats, but he had a vague
idea that the life of that lovely young saw-bones
was menaced by firearms and other
engines of war of a peculiarly deadly description.
He felt that the punishment was
too severe for the crime. Magruder himself,
he was convinced, would have regarded that
orbicularis operation with courageous fortitude and heroic
composure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Magruder then proceeded to give the class practice in
certain operations in medical treatment. She vaccinated
Magruder on the left arm, while one of the students bled his
right arm and showed her companions how to tie up the
vein. They applied leeches to his nose, under the professor's
instructions; they cupped him on the shoulder blades; they
exercised themselves in spreading mustard plasters on his
back; they timed his pulse; they held out his tongue with
pincers and examined it with a microscope, and two or three
enthusiastic students kept hovering around Magruder's leg
with a saw and a carving-knife, until Magruder's brother in
retirement in the closet shuddered with apprehension.</p>

<p>But the professor restrained these devotees of science; and
when the other exercises were ended, she informed the students
that they would devote a few moments in conclusion
to study of the use of the stomach-pump.</p>

<p>Dr. Jones continued: "I shall not enter into particulars
concerning the scene that then ensued. There is a certain
want of poetry about the operation of the weapon just named,
a certain absence of dignity and sentiment, which, I may say,
render it impossible to describe it in a manner which will
elevate the soul and touch the moral sensibilities. It will
<a class="pagenum" id="page_80">[Pg 80]</a>
suffice to observe that as each member of the class attacked
Magruder with that murderous engine, Magruder's brother,
timid as he was, solemnly declared to himself that if the class
would put away those saws and things he would rush out and
rescue his brother at the risk of his life.</p>

<p>"He was saved the necessity of thus imperiling his safety.
Magruder began to revive. He turned over; he sat up; he
stared wildly at the company; he looked at his wife; then
he sank back upon the sofa and said to her, in a feeble voice:</p>

<p>'Henrietta, somehow or other I feel awfully hungry!'"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus082.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Hungry! Magruder's brother considered that, after that
last performance of the class, Magruder ought to have a
relish for a couple of raw buffaloes, at least. He emerged
from the closet, and seizing a chair, determined to tell the
whole story. Mrs. Magruder and the class screamed, but
he proceeded. Then up rose Magruder and discussed the
subject with vehemence, while his brother brandished his
chair and joined in the chorus. Mrs. Magruder and the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_81">[Pg 81]</a>
class cried, and said Mr. Magruder was a brute, and he had
no love for science. But Mr. Magruder said that as for
himself, 'hang science!' when a woman became so infatuated
with it as to chop up her husband to help it along. And
his brother said he ought to put in even stronger terms
than that. What followed upon the adjournment of the
class is not known. But Magruder seems somehow to have
lost much of his interest in medicine, and since then there
has been a kind of coolness between him and the professor."</p>

<p>I shall repeat this extraordinary narrative to Mr. Parker.
He ought to be aware of the propensities of his prospective
mother-in-law beforehand, so that he may not encounter the
dangers which attend her devotion to her profession without
realizing the fact of their existence. Admitting that Jones
adheres closely to truth in his statement, we may very
reasonably fear that Mrs. Magruder would not hesitate to
vivisect a mere son-in-law, or in an extreme case to remove
one of his legs. A mother-in-law with such dangerous proclivities
ought not to be accepted rashly or in haste. Prudence
requires that she should be meditated upon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I want to ask you a question," observed Mr. Parker,
as we sat out upon the porch after tea with Mrs. Adeler.
"I notice that you always say 'is being done,' and not 'is
doing.' Now, which is correct? I think you're wrong.
Some of those big guns who write upon such subjects think
so too. Grind us out an opinion."</p>

<p>"The subject has been much discussed, Bob, and a good
many smart things have been said in support of both theories.
But I stick to 'is being done,' first, because it is more
common, and therefore handier, and second, because it is the
only form that is really available in all cases. Suppose, for
instance, you wished to express the idea that our boy Agamemnon
is enduring chastisement; you would say, 'Agamemnon
<a class="pagenum" id="page_82">[Pg 82]</a>
is being spanked,' not 'Agamemnon is spanking.' The
difference may seem to you very slight, but it would be a
matter of considerable importance to Agamemnon; and if a
choice should be given him, it is probable that he would suddenly
select the latter form."</p>

<p>"Just so," exclaimed Mr. Parker.</p>

<p>"You say again, 'Captain Cook is being eaten.' Certainly
this expresses a very different fact from that which is
conveyed by the form, 'Captain Cook is eating.' I venture
to say that Captain Cook would have insisted upon the latter
as by far the more agreeable of the two things."</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Mr. Parker.</p>

<p>"And equally diverse are the two ideas expressed by the
phrases 'The mule is being kicked' and 'The mule is kicking.'
But it is to be admitted that there are occasions when
the two forms indicate a precisely similar act. You assert,
I will say, that 'Hannah is hugging.'"</p>

<p>"Which would be a very improper thing for Hannah to
do," suggested Mr. P.</p>

<p>"Of course it would; but there is an extreme probability
that you would indicate Hannah's action under the circumstances
if you should say, 'Hannah is being hugged.' It is
in most cases a reciprocal act. Or suppose I say, 'Jane is
kissing'?"</p>

<p>"And her mother ought to know about it if she is," remarked
Bob.</p>

<p>"It is nearly the same as if I should say, 'Jane is being
kissed,' for one performance in most cases presupposes the
other. It will not, however, be necessary for you to attempt
to prove this fact by practice anywhere in the neighborhood
of the Magruder mansion. If you find it necessary to explain
to Miss Magruder my views of this grammatical question,
it will be better to confine your illustrations to the case
of Captain Cook. But you can safely continue to say, 'is
<a class="pagenum" id="page_83">[Pg 83]</a>
being built.' Nobody will object to that but a few superfine
people who are so far ahead of you in such matters that they
will be tolerably sure to regard you as an idiot whichever
form you happen to use, while if you adopt the other form
in conversation with your unfastidious acquaintances, you
will be likely to confuse your meaning very often in such a
manner as to impress them with the conviction that your
reason is dethroned."</p>

Personal Characteristics of Colonel Bangs&mdash;The Affair
with the Tombstone&mdash;Art News&mdash;Colonel Bangs
in the Heat of a Political Campaign&mdash;Peculiar Troubles
of Public Singers&mdash;The Phenomena of Menageries&mdash;Extraordinary

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus086.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>The editor of our daily paper,
<i>The Morning Argus</i>, is Col. Bangs&mdash;Colonel Mortimer
J. Bangs. The colonel is an exceedingly important personage
in the village, and he bears about him the air
of a man who is acutely conscious of the fact. The gait
of the colonel, the peculiar way in which he carries his
head, the manner in which he swings his cane, and the
art he has of impressing any one he happens to address
with a feeling that he is performing an act of sublime
condescension in permitting himself to hold communication
with an inferior being, combine to excite in the vulgar
mind a sentiment of awe. The eminent journalist manifests
in his entire bearing his confidence in the theory that upon
him devolves the responsibility of forming the public opinion
<a class="pagenum" id="page_85">[Pg 85]</a>
of the place; and there is a certain grandeur in the manner
in which he conveys to the public mind, through the public
eye, the fact that while he appreciates the difficulties of
what seemed to be an almost superhuman task, which would
surely overwhelm men of smaller intellectual calibre, the
work presents itself to his mind as something not much
more formidable than pastime.</p>

<p>The appearance of Colonel Bangs is not only imposing,
but sometimes it inclines to be almost ferocious. The form
in which he wears his whiskers, added to the military nature
of his title, would be likely to give to timid strangers an idea
not only that the colonel has a raging and insatiable thirst
for blood and an almost irresistible appetite for the horrors
of war, but that upon very slight provocation he would
suddenly grasp his sword, fling away the scabbard, and then
proceed to wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the
gates of mercy on mankind. But I rejoice to say that the
colonel has not really such murderous and revolutionary inclinations.
His title was obtained in those early years of
peace when he led the inoffensive forces of the militia upon
parade, and marshaled them as they braved the perils of the
target-shooting excursion.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus087.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>I think I am warranted in saying that Colonel Bangs
would never voluntarily stand
in the imminent deadly breach
if there happened to be a man
there with a gun who wanted
him to leave, and that he will
never seek the bubble reputation
at the cannon's mouth unless the
cannon happens to be unloaded.
Place Colonel Bangs in front of
an empty cannon, and for a proper consideration he would
remain there for years without the quiver of a muscle.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_86">[Pg 86]</a>
Charge that piece of ordnance with powder and ball, and
not all the wealth of the world would induce him to stand
anywhere but in the rear of the artillery.</p>

<p>The <i>Argus</i> has never appeared to me to be an especially
brilliant journal. To the intelligent and critical reader, indeed,
the controlling purpose of the colonel seems to be to
endeavor to ascertain how near he can bring the paper to
imbecility without actually reaching that condition; and it
is surprising how close a shave he makes of it. When we
first came to the village, a gleam of intelligence now and then
appeared in the editorial columns of the <i>Argus</i>, and this
phenomenon was generally attributed to the circumstance
that Colonel Bangs had permitted his assistant editor to
spread his views before the public. On such occasions it
was entertaining to observe in what manner the colonel
would assume the honors of the authorship of his assistant's
articles. Cooley, for instance, meeting him upon the street
would observe:</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus088.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"That was an uncommonly good thing, colonel, which appeared
in the <i>Argus</i> this morning on The Impending Struggle; whose
was it?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Bangs</span> (with an air of
mingled surprise and indignation). "Whose was it? Whose was that
article? I suppose you are aware, sir, that <i>I</i> am the editor of
<span class="smcap">The</span>
<span class="smcap">Morning Argus</span>!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cooley.</span> "Yes; but I thought perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel</span> (with grandeur). "No
matter, sir, what you thought. When an article appears in my own
paper, Mr. Cooley, there is but a single inference to be
<a class="pagenum" id="page_87">[Pg 87]</a>
drawn. When I find myself unable to edit the <i>Argus</i>, I
will sell out, sir&mdash;I will sell out!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cooley</span> (calmly). "Well, but Murphy, your assistant,
told me distinctly that he wrote that editorial himself."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel</span> (coming down). "Ah! yes, yes! that is partly
true, now I remember. I believe Murphy did scratch off
the body of the article, but I overhauled it; it was necessary
for me to revise it, to touch it up, to throw it into shape,
as it were, before it went into type. Murphy means well,
and with a little guidance&mdash;just a l-e-e-t-l-e careful training&mdash;he
will do."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus089.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>But Murphy did not remain long. One of the colonel's
little nephews died, and a man who kept a marble-yard in
Wilmington thought he might obtain a gratuitous advertisement
by giving to the afflicted uncle a substantial expression
of his sympathy. So he got up a gravestone for
the departed child. The design, cut upon the stone in bas-relief,
represented an angel carrying the little one in his
<a class="pagenum" id="page_88">[Pg 88]</a>
arms and flying away with it, while a woman sat weeping
upon the ground. It was executed in a most dreadful manner.
The tombstone was sent to the colonel, with a simple
request that he would accept it. As he was absent, Mr.
Murphy determined to acknowledge the gift, although he
had not the slightest idea what it meant. So the next morning
he burst out in the <i>Argus</i> with the following remarks:</p>

<h2>"ART NEWS.</h2>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus090.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"We have received from the eminent sculptor, Mr. Felix
Mullins of Wilmington, a comic <i>bas-relief</i> designed for an
ornamental fireboard. It represents an Irishman in his
night-shirt running away with the little god Cupid, while
the Irishman's sweetheart demurely hangs her head in the
corner. Every true work of art tells its own story; and we
understand, as soon as we glance at this, that our Irish
friend has been coqueted with by the fair one, and is pretending
to transfer his love to other quarters. There is a
lurking smile on the Irishman's lips which expresses his
<a class="pagenum" id="page_89">[Pg 89]</a>
mischievous intentions perfectly. We think it would have
been better, however, to have clothed him in something else
than a night-shirt, and to have smoothed down his hair. We
have placed this <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> upon a shelf in our office, where
it will undoubtedly be admired by our friends when they call.
We are glad to encourage such progress in Delaware art."</p>

<p>This was painful. When the colonel returned next day,
Mr. Mullins called on him and explained the tombstone to
him, and that very night Mr. Murphy retired from the
<i>Morning Argus</i>, and began to seek fresh fields
for the exercise of his talents.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus091.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Colonel Bangs affords me most entertainment
in the <i>Argus</i> when an election is approaching.</p>

<p>Your city editor often displays a certain
amount of vehemence at such times, but his
wildest frenzy is calmness, is absolute slumberous repose
itself, when compared with the frantic enthusiasm manifested
by Colonel Bangs. The latter succeeds in getting up
as much fury over a candidate for constable as a city editor
does over an aspirant for the Presidency. He will turn out
column after column of double-leaded type, in which he will
demonstrate with a marvelous profusion of adjectives that
if you should roll all the prophets, saints and martyrs into
one, you would have a much smaller amount of virtue than
can be found in that one humble man who wants to be constable.
He will prove to you that unless that particular
person is elected, the entire fabric of American institutions
will totter to its base and become a bewildering and hopeless
ruin, while the merciless despots who grind enslaved millions
beneath their iron heels will greet the hideous and irreclaimable
chaos with fiendish laughter, and amid the remnants
of a once proud republic they will erect bastiles in
which they will forge chains to fetter the wrists of dismayed
and heart-broken patriots. He will ask you to take your
<a class="pagenum" id="page_90">[Pg 90]</a>
choice between electing that man constable and witnessing
the annihilation of the proud work for which the Revolutionary
patriots bled and died.</p>

<p>The man who runs against the candidate of the <i>Argus</i>
will be proved to be a moral and intellectual wreck, and it
will be shown that all the vices which have corrupted the
race since the fall of man are concentrated in that one individual.
The day after election, if his man wins, Colonel
Bangs will decorate his paper with a whole array of roosters
and a menagerie of 'coons, and inform a breathless world
that the nation is once more saved. If he loses, he will
omit any reference to the frightful prophecies uttered during
the campaign, keep his roosters in the closet, and mildly
assert that the opposition man is not so bad, after all, and
that the right party must triumph next time for certain.
Then Colonel Bangs will keep his enthusiasm cool for a
year, and during that period will rest his overwrought
brain, while he edits his paper with a pair of predatory
shears and a dishonest paste-pot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is extremely probable that we shall lose our servant-girl.
She was the victim of a very singular catastrophe a
night or two since, in consequence of which she has acquired
a prejudice against the house of Adeler. We were troubled
with dampness in our cellar, and in order to remove the
difficulty we got a couple of men to come and dig the earth
out to the depth of twelve or fifteen inches and fill it in
with a cement-and-mortar floor. The material was, of
course, very soft, and the workmen laid boards upon the
surface, so that access to the furnace and the coal-bin was
possible. That night, just after retiring, we heard a woman
screaming for help, but after listening at the open window,
we concluded that Cooley and his wife were engaged in an
altercation, and so we paid no more attention to the noise.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_91">[Pg 91]</a>
Half an hour afterward there was a violent ring at the front-door
bell, and upon going to the window again, I found Pitman
standing upon the door-step below. When I spoke to
him, he said:</p>

<p>"Max" (the judge is inclined sometimes, especially during
periods of excitement, to be unnecessarily familiar), "there's
somethin' wrong in your cellar. There's a woman down
there screechin' and carryin' on like mad. Sounds 's if
somebody's a-murderin' her."</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus093a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>I dressed and descended; and securing the
assistance of Pitman, so that I would be better
prepared in the event of burglars being discovered,
I lighted a lamp and we went into the
cellar.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus093b.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>There we found the maid-servant
standing by the refrigerator,
knee-deep in the cement,
and supporting herself with the
handle of a broom, which was
also half submerged. In several
places about her were air-holes
marking the spot where
the milk-jug, the cold veal, the
lima beans and the silver-plated
butter-dish had gone down. We
procured some additional boards,
and while Pitman seized the sufferer
by one arm I grasped the other. It was for some
time doubtful if she would come to the surface without
the use of more violent means, and I confess that I was
half inclined to regard with satisfaction the prospect that
we would have to blast her loose with gunpowder. After
a desperate struggle, during which the girl declared that
she would be torn in pieces, Pitman and I succeeded in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_92">[Pg 92]</a>
getting her safely out, and she went up stairs with half
a barrel of cement on each leg, declaring
that she would leave the house in the morning.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus094a.jpg" width="100%"

</div>

<p>The cold veal is in there yet. Centuries hence some antiquarian will perhaps grub
about the spot whereon my cottage once stood, and will blow
that cold veal out in a petrified condition, and then present it to
a museum as the fossil remains of some unknown animal. Perhaps,
too, he will excavate the milk-jug and the butter-dish, and
go about lecturing upon them as
utensils employed in bygone ages by a race of savages
called "the Adelers." I should like to be alive at the time
to hear that lecture. And I cannot avoid the thought that
<a class="pagenum" id="page_93">[Pg 93]</a>
if our servant had been completely buried in the cement,
and thus carefully preserved until the coming of that antiquarian,
the lecture would be more interesting, and the girl
more useful than she is now. A fossilized domestic servant
of the present era would probably astonish the people of the
twenty-eighth century.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I see," said Mrs. Adeler, who was looking over the
evening paper upon the day following the accident, "that
Mlle. Willson, the opera-singer, has been robbed of ten thousand
dollars' worth of diamonds in St. Louis. What a
dreadful loss!"</p>

<p>"Dreadful, indeed, Mrs. A. These singing women are
very unfortunate. They are constantly being robbed, or
rolled over embankments in railway cars, or subjected to
deadly perils in some other form; and the astonishing thing
about it all is that these frightful things invariably occur
precisely at the times when public interest in the victims
begins to flag a little, and the accounts always appear in the
papers of a certain city just before the singers begin an engagement
in that place. It is very remarkable."</p>

<p>"You don't think this story is false, do you, and that all
such statements are untrue?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I only refer to the fact because it shows
how very wonderful coincidences often are. I have observed
precisely the same thing in connection with other contributors
to popular entertainment. But in these cases sometimes
we may trace the effects directly to the cause. Take
menageries, for example. The peculiar manifestations which
frequently attend the movements of these collections of wild
animals through the land can be attributed only to the wonderful
instinct of the beasts. If I am to judge from the
reports that appear occasionally in the provincial newspapers,
it invariably happens that the animals come to the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_94">[Pg 94]</a>
rescue of the menagerie people when the latter begin their
campaigns and are badly in want of advertisements for
which they are disinclined to pay.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus096a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"Regularly every season these ferocious beasts proceed to
do something to secure sensational allusions to themselves in
the papers. If the rhinoceros does not plunge through the
side of the tent and prowl about until he comes home
with an entire Sunday-school class of small boys impaled
on his horn, the Nubian lion is perfectly certain to bite
its keeper in half and lunch upon his legs. If the elephant
should neglect to seize his attendant and fling him into the
parquet circle, while at the same time it crushes the hyena into
jelly, the Bengal tiger is very sure not to forget to tear half
a dozen ribs out of the ticket agent, and then to assimilate
ten or twelve village children who are trying to peep under
the tent. Either the brass
band, riding upon the den of lions, finds the roof caving
in, and at last is rescued with the loss of the cymbal
player and the operator upon the key bugle, and of a lot of
legs and arms snatched from the bass drummer and the man
with the triangle, or else there is a railroad accident which
empties the cars and permits kangaroos, panthers, blue-nose
baboons and boa-constrictors to roam about the country reducing
<a class="pagenum" id="page_95">[Pg 95]</a>
the majorities of the afflicted sections previous to the
election.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus096b.jpg" width="100%"

title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"You may find hundreds of accounts of such accidents in
the rural press during the summer season; and whenever I
read them, I am at a loss to determine which is more wonderful,
the remarkable sagacity and the self-sacrificing devotion
of these beasts, which perceive that something must be
done and straightway do it, or the childlike confidence, the
bland simplicity, of the editors who give gratuitous circulation
to these narratives."</p>

<p>"Talking about menageries," observed Mr. Bob Parker,
"did I ever tell you about Wylie and his love affair?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Wylie, you know, was the brother of the porter in our
store; and when he had nothing to do, he used to come
around and sit in the cellar among the boxes and bales, and
we fellows would go down when we were at leisure and hear
him relate his adventures.</p>

<p>"One time, several years ago, he was awfully hard up
and he accepted a situation in a traveling show. They
dressed him up in a fur shirt and put grizzly bears' claws
on his feet and daubed some stuff over his face, and advertised
him as 'The Wild Man of Afghanistan.' Then, when
the show was open, he would stand in a cage and scrouge up
against the bars and growl until he would scare the children
nearly to death. The fat woman used to sit near him during
the exhibitions just outside the cage, and by degrees he
learned to love her. The keeper of the concern himself, it
appears, also cherished a tender feeling for the corpulent
young creature, and he became jealous of the Wild Man of
Afghanistan."</p>

<p>"And the professor of avoirdupois&mdash;whom did she affect?"</p>

<p>"Well, when the visitors came, the keeper would procure
a pole with a nail in the end, and he would stir up the Wild
<a class="pagenum" id="page_96">[Pg 96]</a>
Man and poke him. Then he would ridicule the Wild
Man's legs and deliver lectures upon the manner in which
he turned in his toes; and he sometimes read to the audience
chapters out of books of natural history to show that a being
with a skull of such a shape must necessarily be an idiot.
Then he would poke the Wild Man of Afghanistan a few
more times with the pole and pass on to the next cage with
some remarks tending to prove that the monkeys therein
and the Wild Man were of the same general type."</p>

</div>

<p>"And all the time the fat woman would sit there and
smile a cold and disdainful smile, as if she believed it all,
and hated such legs and despised toes that
turned in. At last the Wild Man of Afghanistan
had his revenge. One day when
all hands were off duty, the keeper fell
asleep on the settee in the ticket-office adjoining
the show-room. Then Mr. Wylie threw a blanket
over him and went for the fat woman. He led her by the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_97">[Pg 97]</a>
hand and asked her to be seated while he told her about his
love. Then she suddenly sat down on the keeper."</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>"Wylie informed me that you could have passed the remains
under a closed door without scraping the buttons of
the waistcoat. They merely slid him into a crack in the
ground when they buried him, and
the fat woman pined away until she
became thin and valueless. Then
the Wild Man married her, and began
life again on a new basis."</p>

<p>"Was Mr. Wylie what you might consider a man of veracity?"</p>

<p>"Certainly he was; and his story is undoubtedly true, because his
toes did turn in."</p>

<p>"That settles the matter. With such incontrovertible evidence as
that at hand, it would be folly to doubt the story. We will go quietly
and confidently to tea instead of discussing it."</p>

<p>The closing hours of the long summer afternoon can be spent in
no pleasanter place than by the water's side. And after tea I
like to take my little group of Adelers out from the hot streets
over the grassy way which leads to the river shore, and to find a
comfortable loitering-place upon the Battery. That spot is adorned
with a long row of rugged old trees whose trunks are gashed
and scarred by the penknives of idlers. Their branches interlock
overhead and form one
great mass of tender green foliage, here sweeping down
almost to the earth, and there hanging far out over the
water, trembling and rustling in the breeze. Beneath, there
is a succession of hewn logs, suggesting the existence of some
sort of a wharf in the remote past, but now serving nicely
for seats for those who come here to spend a quiet hour.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_100">[Pg 100]</a>
Around there is a sod which grows lush and verdant, excepting
where the tread of many feet has worn a pathway
backward to the village.</p>

<p>In front is as lovely a scene as any the eye can rest upon
in this portion of the world. Below us the rising and the
ebbing tides hurl the tiny ripples upon the pebbly beach, and
the perpetual wash of the waves makes that gentle and constant
music which is among the most grateful of the sounds
of nature.</p>

<p>Away to the southward sweeps the Delaware shore line in
a mighty curve which gives the river here the breadth and
magnificence of a great lake, and at the end of the chord
of the arc the steeples and the masts at Delaware City rise
in indistinct outline from the waves. To the left, farther in
the distance, old Fort Delaware lifts its battlements above
the surface of the stream. And see! A puff of white smoke
rises close by the flag-staff. And now a dull thud comes
with softened cadence across the wide interval. It is the
sunset gun. Far, far beyond, a sail glimmers with rosy
light caught from the brilliant hues of the clouds which
make the western heavens glorious with their crimson
drapery; and while here as we gaze straight out through
the bay there is naught in the perspective but water and
sky, to the right the low-lying land below the island fortress
seems, somehow, to be queerly suspended between river and
heaven, until as it recedes it grows more and more shadowy,
and at last melts away into the mist that creeps in from the
ocean. It is pure happiness to sit here beneath the trees and
to look upon the scene while the cool air pours in from the
water and lifts into the upper atmosphere the oppressive heat
that has mantled the earth during the day.</p>

<p>I do not know why the place is called "the Battery."
Perhaps a couple of centuries ago the Swedes may have
built here a breastwork with which to menace their hated
<a class="pagenum" id="page_103">[Pg 103]</a>
Dutch rivals who held the fort just below us there upon
the river bank. (We will walk over to the spot some day,
Mrs. Adeler.) And who can tell what strange old Northmen in
jerkin and helmet have marched up and down this very stretch of
level sward, carrying huge fire-lock muskets and swearing mighty
oaths as they watched the intruding Dutchman in his stronghold,
caring little for the placid loveliness of the view which the rolling
tide of the majestic river ever offered to their eyes!</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_101">[Pg 101]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But some of those people could appreciate this beautiful
panorama. Some of them did not forget the grandeur of
nature while their little passions raged against the Dutchmen.
It was Jasper Dankers who came here from Sweden
in 1676, and looked out from this Battery; returning home,
he wrote in his diary in this fashion:</p>

<p>"The town is situated upon a point which extends out with
a sandy beach, affording a good landing-place. It lies a
little above the bay where the river bends and runs south
from there, so that you can see down the river southwardly.
The greater portion of it presents a beautiful view in perspective,
and enables you to see from a distance the ships
come out from the great bay and sail up the river."</p>

<p>The sandy beach is gone, and the ships which float
upward from the bay are not such craft as Dankers saw;
but the stream has its ancient majesty, and the wooded banks,
I like to think, present to our eyes nearly the same sweet
picture that touched the soul of that old Swede two long
centuries ago.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_104">[Pg 104]</a></p>

<p>Another thing has changed&mdash;yes, it has changed many
times. The Indians, Mrs. A., called the bay Poutaxat
and the river Lenape Wihittuck. The stream, too, was
named the Arasapha, and also Mackerish Kitton&mdash;A title
pretty enough in its way, but oddly suggestive of mackerel
and kittens. But the Swedes came, and with that passion
which burned in the bosoms of all the early European immigrants
for prefixing the word "new" to the names of natural
objects, they entitled the river New Swedeland Stream. Then
the Dutch obtained the mastery here, and it became the
South River, the Hudson being the North River, and finally
the English obtained possession, and called it Delaware.</p>

<p>What a pity it is that they didn't suffer one of the original
titles to remain! The Lenape would have been a
beautiful name for the river&mdash;far better than the Gallic
compound that it bears now. The men who settled this
country seem to have had for Indian names the same intense
dislike that they entertained for the savages themselves, and
as a rule they rejected with scorn the soft, sweet syllables with
which mountain and forest and stream were crowned, substituting
too often most barbarous words therefor. Even Penn
and his Quakers disdained the Indian names. How much
better Pennsylvania would have been treated if that grand
old State had been called Susquehanna or Juniata or Allegheny!
And would it not have been wiser if the city,
instead of bringing its name from Asia, had sought it
among its own surroundings, and had grown to greatness as
Wissahickon or Wingohocking? The Indian names that
still remain here and there to designate a stream, a district
or a town are the few distinctly American words in existence.
We have thrown away the others, although they were a very
precious part of the legacy which we received from the race
we have supplanted. One such word as Wyoming is worth
an entire volume of such names as New York, Philadelphia,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_105">[Pg 105]</a>
Baltimore, Maryland and the like; and I have always
wondered at the blundering folly of the man who, with
such musical syllables at hand ready to be used, dubbed
the town of Wilkes Barre with that particularly poor
name.</p>

<p>While we were sitting by the river discussing these and
other matters, Cooley's boy, a thoroughly disagreeable
urchin, who had been playing with some other boys upon
the wharf near by, tumbled into the water. There was a
terrible screaming among his companions, and a crowd
quickly gathered upon the pier. For a few moments it
seemed as if the boy would drown, for no one was disposed
to leap in after him, and there was not a boat within saving
distance. But fortunately the current swept him around to
the front of the Battery, where the water is shallow, and
before he was seriously hurt he was safely landed in the
mud that stretches below the low-water mark. Then the
excitement, which had been so great as to attract about half
the population of the village, died away, and people who
had just been filled with horror at the prospect of a tragedy
began to feel a sense of disappointment because their fears
had not been realized. I cannot of course say that I was
sorry to see the youngster once more upon dry land; but if
fate had robbed us of him, we
should have accepted the dispensation
without grievous complaint.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus107.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>We did not leave all the nuisances behind us in the city.
Cooley's dog and his boy are two very sore afflictions which
make life even here very much sadder than it ought to be in
a place that pretends to be something in the nature of an
<a class="pagenum" id="page_106">[Pg 106]</a>
earthly paradise. The boy not only preys upon my melon-patch
and fruit trees and upon those of my neighbors, but he
has an extraordinary aptitude for creating a disturbance in
whatever spot he happens to be. Only last Sunday he caused
such a terrible commotion in church that the services had
to be suspended for several minutes until he could be removed.
The interior of the edifice was painted and varnished
recently, and I suppose one of the workmen must have left
a clot of varnish upon the back of Cooley's pew, which is
directly across the aisle from mine. Cooley's boy was the
only representative of the family at church upon that day,
and he amused himself during the earlier portions of the
service by kneeling upon the seat and communing with Dr.
Jones's boy, who occupied the pew immediately in the rear.
Sometimes, when young Cooley would resume a proper position,
Jones's boy would stir him up afresh by slyly pulling his hair,
whereupon Cooley would wheel about and menace Jones with
his fist in a manner which betrayed utter indifference to the
proprieties of the place and the occasion, as well as to the
presence of the congregation. When Cooley finally sank
into a condition of repose, he placed his head, most unfortunately,
directly against the lump of undried varnish, while
he amused himself by reading the commandments and the
other scriptural texts upon the wall behind the pulpit.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus108.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>In a few moments he attempted to move, but the varnish
had mingled with his hair, and it held him securely. After
making one or two desperate but ineffectual efforts to release
himself, he became very angry; and supposing that Jones's
boy was holding him, he shouted:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_107">[Pg 107]</a></p>

<p>"Leg go o' my hair! Leg go o' my hair, I tell you!"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus109a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>The clergyman paused just as he was entering upon consideration
of "secondly," and the congregation looked around
in amazement, in time to perceive young Cooley, with his
head against the back of the pew, aiming dreadful blows
over his shoulder with his fist at some unseen person behind
him. And with every thrust he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I'll smash yer nose after church! I'll go for you, Bill
Jones, when I ketch you alone! Leg go o' my hair, I tell
you, or I'll knock the stuffin' out o' yer," etc., etc.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus109b.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, Jones's boy sat up at the very end of his pew,
far away from Cooley, and looked as solemn as if the sermon
had made a deep impression upon him.
Then the sexton came running up, with the
idea that the boy had fallen asleep and had
nightmare, while Mrs. Dr. Magruder sallied
out from her pew and over to Cooley's, convinced
that he had a fit. When the cause of the disturbance
<a class="pagenum" id="page_108">[Pg 108]</a>
was ascertained, the sexton took out his knife, and after
sawing off enough of Cooley's hair to release him, dragged
him out of church. The victim retreated unwillingly,
glancing around at Jones's boy and shaking his fist at that
urchin as if to indicate that he cherished a deadly purpose
against Jones.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus110.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>Then the sermon proceeded. I suppose a contest between
the two boys has been averted, for only yesterday I saw
Jones and Cooley, the younger, playing hop-scotch together
in the street in apparent forgetfulness of the sorrows of the
sanctuary.</p>

<p>Judge Pitman tells me that one of the reasons why Cooley
<a class="pagenum" id="page_109">[Pg 109]</a>
and his wife disagree is that there is such a difference in their
height. Cooley is tall, and Mrs. Cooley is small. Mrs.
Cooley told Mrs. Pitman, if the judge is to be believed, that
Cooley continually growled because she could not keep step
with him. They always start wrong, somehow, when they
go out together, and then, while he tries to catch step with
her, she endeavors to get in with him. After both have
been shuffling about over the pavement for several minutes
in a perfectly absurd manner, they go ahead out of step just
as before.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus111.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>When Cooley tried to take short steps like hers, his gait
was so ridiculous as to excite remark; while if she tried to
make such long strides as his, people stopped and
looked at her as if they thought she was insane.
Then she would strive to take two steps to his one,
but she found that two and a half of hers were equal to
one of his; and when she undertook to make that fractional
number in order to keep up with him, he would
frown at her and say,</p>

<p>"Mrs. Cooley, if you are
going to dance the polka mazourka upon the public highway,
I'm going home."</p>

<p>I do not receive this statement with implicit confidence in
its truthfulness. Pitman's imagination sometimes glows with
unnatural heat, and he may have embellished the original
narrative of Mrs. Cooley.</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illus112a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>I shall probably never receive from any member of the
Cooley family a correct account of the causes of the unpleasant
<a class="pagenum" id="page_110">[Pg 110]</a>
differences existing therein, for we are on worse
terms than ever with Cooley.
His dog became such an intolerable
nuisance because of his
nocturnal vociferation that some
practical humanitarian in the
neighborhood poisoned him.
Cooley apparently cherished
the conviction that I had killed
the animal, and he flung the
carcass over the fence into my
yard. I threw it back. Cooley returned it. Both of us
remained at home that day, and spent the morning handing
the inanimate brute to each other across the fence. At noon
I called my man to take my place, and Cooley hired a
colored person to relieve him. They kept it up until nightfall,
by which time I suppose the corpse must have worn
away to a great extent, for at sundown my man buried the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_111">[Pg 111]</a>
tail by my rose-bush and came in the house, while Cooley's
representative resigned and went home.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus113a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>The departed brute left behind him but one
pleasant recollection; and when I recall it, I
feel that he fully avenged my wrongs upon his
master. Cooley went out a week or two ago
to swim in the creek, and he took the dog with
him to watch his clothing. While Cooley
bathed the dog slept; but when Cooley emerged from the
water, the dog did not recognize him in his nude condition,
and it refused to let him come near his garments. Whenever
Cooley would attempt to seize a boot or a stocking or a shirt,
the dog flew at him with such ferocity that he dared not attempt
to dress himself. So he stood in the sun until he was
almost broiled; then he went into the water and remained
there, dodging up and down for the purpose of avoiding the
people who passed occasionally along the road. At last the
dog went to sleep again, and Cooley, creeping softly behind the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_112">[Pg 112]</a>
brute, caught it suddenly by the tail and flung it across the
stream. Before the dog could recover its senses and swim
back, Cooley succeeded in getting some of his clothing on him,
and then the dog came sidling up to him looking as if it expected
to be rewarded for its extraordinary vigilance. The
manner in which Cooley kicked the faithful animal is
said to have been simply dreadful.</p>

<p>I should have
entertained a positive
affection for
that dog if it had
not barked at night.
But I am glad it is gone. We came here to have quietness,
and that was unattainable while Cooley's dog remained
within view of the moon.</p>

<p>A rather unusual sensation has been excited in the village by the
<i>Morning Argus</i> within a day or two; and while most
of the readers of that wonderful sheet have thus been supplied
with amusement, the soul of the editor has been filled with gloom and wrath
and despair. Colonel Bangs recently determined to engage
an assistant to take the place
made vacant by the retirement of the eminent art-critic, Mr.
Murphy, and he found in one of the lower counties of the
State a person who appeared to him to be suitable. The
name of the new man is Slimmer. He has often contributed
to the <i>Argus</i> verses of a distressing character, and I suppose
Bangs must have become acquainted with him through the
medium of the correspondence thus begun. No one in the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_114">[Pg 114]</a>
world but Bangs would ever have selected such a poet for
an editorial position. But Bangs is singular&mdash;he is exceptional.
He never operates in accordance with
any known laws, and he is more than likely to
do any given thing in such a fashion as no other
person could possibly have adopted for the purpose.
As the <i>Argus</i> is also <i>sui generis</i>, perhaps
Bangs does right to conduct it in a peculiar
manner. But he made a mistake when he
employed Mr. Slimmer.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus116.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>The colonel, in his own small way, is tolerably
shrewd. He had observed the disposition
of persons who have been bereaved of their
relatives to give expression to their feelings in
verse, and it occurred to him that it might be
profitable to use Slimmer's poetical talent in
such a way as to make the <i>Argus</i> a very
popular vehicle for the conveyance to the
public of notices of deaths. That kind of intelligence,
he well knew, is especially interesting to a very
large class of readers, and he believed that if he could offer
to each advertiser a gratuitous verse to accompany the obituary
paragraph, the <i>Argus</i> would not only attract advertisements
of that description from the country round about the
village, but it would secure a much larger circulation.</p>

<p>When Mr. Slimmer arrived, therefore, and entered upon
the performance of his duties, Colonel Bangs explained his
theory to the poet, and suggested that whenever a death-notice
reached the office, he should immediately write a
rhyme or two which should express the sentiments most
suitable to the occasion.</p>

<p>"You understand, Mr. Slimmer," said the colonel, "that
when the death of an individual is announced I want you,
as it were, to cheer the members of the afflicted family with
<a class="pagenum" id="page_115">[Pg 115]</a>
the resources of your noble art. I wish you to throw yourself,
you may say, into their situation, and to give them, f'r
instance, a few lines about the deceased which will seem to
be the expression of the emotion which agitates the breasts
of the bereaved."</p>

<p>"To lighten the gloom in a certain sense," said Mr. Slimmer,
"and to&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus117.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"Precisely," exclaimed Colonel Bangs. "Lighten the
gloom. Do not mourn over the departed, but rather take
a joyous view of death, which, after all, Mr. Slimmer, is, as
it were, but the entrance to a better life. Therefore, I wish
you to touch the heart-strings of the afflicted with a tender
hand, and to endeavor, f'r instance, to divert their minds from
contemplation of the horrors of the tomb."</p>

<p>"Refrain from despondency, I suppose, and lift their
thoughts to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just so! And at the same time combine elevating sentiment
with such practical information as you can obtain
<a class="pagenum" id="page_116">[Pg 116]</a>
from the advertisement. Throw a glamour of poesy, f'r instance,
over the commonplace details of the every-day life
of the deceased. People are fond of minute descriptions.
Some facts useful for this purpose may be obtained from the
man who brings the notice to the office; others you may
perhaps be able to supply from your imagination."</p>

<p>"I think I can do it first rate," said Mr. Slimmer.</p>

<p>"But, above all," continued the colonel, "try always to
take a bright view of the matter. Cause the sunshine of
smiles, as it were, to burst through the tempest of tears;
and if we don't make the <i>Morning Argus</i> hum around this
town, it will be queer."</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus118.jpg" width="100%"

</div>

<p>Mr. Slimmer had charge of the editorial department the
next day during the absence of Colonel Bangs in Wilmington.
Throughout the afternoon
and evening death-notices arrived;
and when one would
reach Mr. Slimmer's desk, he
would lock the door, place the
fingers of his left hand among
his hair and agonize until he
succeeded in completing a verse
that seemed to him to accord
with his instructions.</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. Slimmer proceeded calmly to the
office for the purpose of embalming in sympathetic verse the
memories of other departed ones. As he came near to the
establishment he observed a crowd of people in front of it,
struggling to get into the door. Ascending some steps upon
the other side of the street, he overlooked the crowd, and
could see within the office the clerks selling papers as fast
as they could handle them, while the mob pushed and yelled
in frantic efforts to obtain copies, the presses in the cellar
meanwhile clanging furiously. Standing upon the curbstone
<a class="pagenum" id="page_117">[Pg 117]</a>
in front of the office there was a long row of men, each of
whom was engaged in reading <i>The Morning Argus</i> with an
earnestness that Mr. Slimmer had never before seen displayed
by the patrons of that sheet. The bard concluded
that either his poetry had touched a sympathetic chord in
the popular heart, or that an appalling disaster
had occurred in some quarter of the
globe.</p>

<p>He went around to the back of the office
and ascended to the editorial rooms. As he
approached the sanctum, loud voices were
heard within. Mr. Slimmer determined to
ascertain the cause before entering. He obtained
a chair, and placing it by the side
door, he mounted and peeped over the door
through the transom. There sat Colonel
Bangs, holding <i>The Morning Argus</i> in both
hands, while the fringe which grew in a
semicircle around the edge of his bald head
stood straight out, until he seemed to resemble
a gigantic gun-swab. Two or three
persons stood in front of him in threatening
attitudes. Slimmer heard one of them say:</p>

<p>"My name is McGlue, sir!&mdash;William McGlue!
I am a brother of the late Alexander McGlue. I
picked up your paper this morning, and perceived in it an
outrageous insult to my deceased relative, and I have come
<a class="pagenum" id="page_118">[Pg 118]</a>
around to demand, sir, WHAT YOU MEAN by the following
infamous language:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus120.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<ol>
<li>"'The death-angel smote Alexander McGlue,</li>
  <li class="i2">And gave him protracted repose;</li>
<li>He wore a checked shirt and a Number Nine shoe,</li>
  <li class="i2">And he had a pink wart on his nose.</li>
<li>No doubt he is happier dwelling in space</li>
  <li class="i2">Over there on the evergreen shore.</li>
<li>His friends are informed that his funeral takes place</li>
  <li class="i2">Precisely at quarter-past four.'</li>
</ol>

<p>"This is simply diabolical! My late brother had no wart
on his nose, sir. He had upon his nose neither a pink wart
nor a green wart, nor a cream-colored wart, nor a wart of
any other color. It is a slander! It is a gratuitous insult
to my family, and I distinctly want you to say <i>what do you
mean</i> by such conduct?"</p>

<p>"Really, sir," said Bangs, "it is a mistake. This is the
horrible work of a miscreant in whom I reposed perfect confidence.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_119">[Pg 119]</a>
He shall be punished by my own hand for this
outrage. A pink wart! Awful! sir&mdash;awful! The miserable
scoundrel shall suffer for this&mdash;he shall, indeed!"</p>

<p>"How could I know," murmured Mr. Slimmer to the
foreman, who with him was listening, "that the corpse
hadn't a pink wart? I used to know a man named McGlue,
and <i>he</i> had one, and I thought <i>all</i> the McGlues had. This
comes of irregularities in families."</p>

<p>"And who," said another man, addressing the editor,
"authorized you to print this hideous stuff about my deceased
son? Do you mean to say, Bangs, that it was not
with your authority that your low comedian inserted with
my advertisement the following scandalous burlesque?
Listen to this:</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus121.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<ol>
<li>"'Willie had a purple monkey climbing on a yellow stick,</li>
  <li class="i2">And when he sucked the paint all off it made him deathly sick;</li>
<li>And in his latest hours he clasped that monkey in his hand,</li>
  <li class="i2">And bade good-bye to earth and went into a better land.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>"'Oh! no more he'll shoot his sister with his little wooden gun;</li>
  <li class="i2">And no more he'll twist the pussy's tail and make her yowl, for fun.</li>
<li>The pussy's tail now stands out straight; the gun is laid aside;</li>
  <li class="i2">The monkey doesn't jump around since little Willie died.'</li>
</ol>

<p>"The atrocious character of this libel will appear when I
say that my son was twenty years old, and that he died of
liver complaint."</p>

<p>"Infamous!&mdash;utterly infamous!" groaned the editor as
he cast his eyes over the lines. "And the wretch who did
this still remains unpunished! It is too much!"</p>

<p>"And yet," whispered Slimmer to the foreman, "he told
me to lighten the gloom and to cheer the afflicted family
<a class="pagenum" id="page_120">[Pg 120]</a>
with the resources of my art; and I certainly thought, that
idea about the monkey would have that effect, somehow.
Bangs is ungrateful!"</p>

<p>Just then there was a knock at the door, and a woman
entered, crying.</p>

<p>"Are you the editor?" she inquired of Colonel Bangs.</p>

<p>Bangs said he was.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus122.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"W-w-well!" she said, in a voice broken by sobs, "wh-what
d'you mean by publishing this kind of poetry about
m-my child? M-my name is Sm-Smith; and wh-when I
looked this m-morning for the notice of Johnny's d-death in
your paper, I saw this scandalous verse:</p>

<ol>
<li>Four doctors tackled Johnny Smith&mdash;</li>
  <li class="i2">They blistered and they bled him;</li>
<li>With squills and anti-bilious pills</li>
  <li class="i2">And ipecac, they fed him.</li>
<li>They stirred him up with calomel,</li>
  <li class="i2">And tried to move his liver;</li>
<li>But all in vain&mdash;his little soul</li>
  <li class="i2">Was wafted o'er The River.'</li>
</ol>

<p>"It's false! false! and mean! Johnny only had <i>one</i> doctor.
And they d-didn't bl-bleed him and b-blister him.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_121">[Pg 121]</a>
It's a wicked falsehood, and you're a hard-hearted brute f-f-for
printing it!"</p>

<p>"Madam, I shall go crazy!" exclaimed Bangs. "This is
not my work. It is the work of a villain whom I will slay
with my own hand as soon as he comes in. Madam, the
miserable outcast shall die!"</p>

<p>"Strange! strange!" said Slimmer. "And this man told
me to combine elevating sentiment with practical information.
If the information concerning the squills and ipecac.
is not practical, I have misunderstood the use of that word.
And if young Smith didn't have four doctors, it was an outrage.
He ought to have had them, and they ought to have
excited his liver. Thus it is that human life is sacrificed to
carelessness."</p>

<p>At this juncture the sheriff entered, his brow clothed with
thunder. He had a copy of <i>The Morning Argus</i> in his
hand. He approached the editor, and pointing to a death-notice,
said,</p>

<p>"Read that outrageous burlesque, and tell me the name
of the writer, so that I can chastise him."</p>

<p>The editor read as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>"We lost our little Hanner in a very painful manner,</li>
  <li class="i2">And we often asked, How can her harsh sufferings be borne?</li>
<li>When her death was first reported, her aunt got up and snorted</li>
  <li class="i2">With the grief that she supported, for it made her feel forlorn.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>"She was such a little seraph that her father, who is sheriff,</li>
  <li class="i2">Really doesn't seem to care if he ne'er smiles in life again.</li>
<li>She has gone, we hope, to heaven, at the early age of seven</li>
  <li class="i2">(Funeral starts off at eleven), where she'll nevermore have pain."</li>
</ol>

<p>"As a consequence of this, I withdraw all the county
advertising from your paper. A man who could trifle in
this manner with the feelings of a parent is a savage and a
scoundrel!"</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_122">[Pg 122]</a></p>

<p>As the sheriff went out, Colonel Bangs placed his head
upon the table and groaned.</p>

<p>"Really," Mr. Slimmer said, "that person must be deranged.
I tried, in his case, to put myself in his place, and
to write as if I was one of the family, according to instructions.
The verses are beautiful. That allusion to the grief
of the aunt, particularly, seemed to me to be very happy.
It expresses violent emotion with a felicitous combination of
sweetness and force. These people have no soul&mdash;no appreciation
of the beautiful in art."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus124.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>While the poet mused, hurried steps were heard upon the
stairs, and in a moment a middle-aged man dashed in
abruptly, and seizing the colonel's scattered hair, bumped
his prostrate head against the table three or four times with
considerable force. Having expended the violence of his
emotion in this manner, he held the editor's head down with
one hand, shaking it occasionally by way of emphasis, and
with the other hand seized the paper and said,</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_123">[Pg 123]</a></p>

<p>"You disgraceful old reprobate! You disgusting vampire!
You hoary-headed old ghoul! What d'you mean by
putting such stuff as this in your paper about my deceased
son? What d'you mean by printing such awful doggerel as
this, you depraved and dissolute ink-slinger&mdash;you imbecile
quill-driver, you!</p>

<ol>
<li>"'Oh! bury Bartholomew out in the woods,</li>
  <li class="i2">In a beautiful hole in the ground,</li>
<li>Where the bumble-bees buzz and the woodpeckers sing,</li>
  <li class="i2">And the straddle-bugs tumble around;</li>
<li>So that, in winter, when the snow and the slush</li>
  <li class="i2">Have covered his last little bed,</li>
<li>His brother Artemas can go out with Jane</li>
  <li class="i2">And visit the place with his sled.'</li>
</ol>

<p>"I'll teach you to talk about straddle-bugs! I'll instruct
you about slush! I'll enlighten your insane old intellect on
the subject of singing woodpeckers! What do <i>you</i> know
about Jane and Artemas, you wretched buccaneer, you despicable
butcher of the English language? Go out with a
sled! I'll carry you out in a hearse before I'm done with
you, you deplorable lunatic!"</p>

<p>At the end of every phrase the visitor gave the editor's
head a fresh knock against the table. When the exercise
was ended, Colonel Bangs explained and apologized in the
humblest manner, promising at the same time to give his
assailant a chance to flog Mr. Slimmer, who was expected to
arrive in a few moments.</p>

<p>"The treachery of this man," murmured the poet to the
foreman, "is dreadful. Didn't he desire me to throw a
glamour of poesy over commonplace details? But for that
I should never have thought of alluding to woodpeckers and
bugs, and other children of Nature. The man objects to
the remarks about the sled. Can the idiot know that it was
necessary to have a rhyme for 'bed'? Can he suppose that
<a class="pagenum" id="page_124">[Pg 124]</a>
I could write poetry without rhymes? The man is a lunatic!
He ought not to be at large!"</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus126.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>Hardly had the indignant and energetic parent of Bartholomew
departed when a man with red hair and a ferocious
glare in his eyes entered,
carrying a club and accompanied
by a savage-looking dog.</p>

<p>"I want to see the editor," he shouted.</p>

<p>A ghastly pallor overspread the colonel's face, and he said,</p>

<p>"The editor is not in."</p>

<p>"Well, when <i>will</i> he be in, then?"</p>

<p>"Not for a week&mdash;for a month&mdash;for a year&mdash;for
ever! He will never come
in any more!" screamed Bangs. "He has gone to South
America, with the intention to remain there during the rest
of his life. He has departed. He has fled. If you want
to see him, you had better follow him to the equator. He
will be glad to see you. I would advise you, as a friend, to
take the next boat&mdash;to start at once."</p>

<p>"That is unfortunate," said the man; "I came all the
way from Delaware City for the purpose of battering him
up a lot with this club."</p>

<p>"He will be sorry," said Bangs, sarcastically. "He will
regret missing you. I will write to him, and mention that
you dropped in."</p>

<p>"My name is McFadden," said the man. "I came to
break the head of the man who wrote that obituary poetry
about my wife. If you don't tell me who perpetrated the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_125">[Pg 125]</a>
following, I'll break <i>yours</i> for you. Where's the man who
wrote this? Pay attention:</p>

<ol>
<li>"'Mrs. McFadden has gone from this life;</li>
  <li class="i2">She has left all its sorrows and cares;</li>
<li>She caught the rheumatics in both of her legs</li>
  <li class="i2">While scrubbing the cellar and stairs.</li>
<li>They put mustard-plasters upon her in vain;</li>
  <li class="i2">They bathed her with whisky and rum;</li>
<li>But Thursday her spirit departed, and left</li>
  <li class="i2">Her body entirely numb.'"</li>
</ol>

<p>"The man who held the late Mrs. McFadden up to the
scorn of an unsympathetic world in that shocking manner,"
said the editor, "is named James B. Slimmer. He boards
in Blank street, fourth door from the corner. I would advise
you to call on him and avenge Mrs. McFadden's wrongs
with an intermixture of club and dog-bites."</p>

<p>"And this," sighed the poet, outside the door, "is the man
who told me to divert McFadden's mind from contemplation
of the horrors of the tomb. It was this monster who counseled
me to make the sunshine of McFadden's smiles burst
through the tempest of McFadden's tears. If that red-headed
monster couldn't smile over that allusion to whisky
and rum, if those remarks about the rheumatism in her legs
could not divert his mind from the horrors of the tomb,
was it <i>my</i> fault? McFadden grovels! He knows no more
about poetry than a mule knows about the Shorter Catechism."</p>

<p>The poet determined to leave before any more criticisms
were made upon his performances. He jumped down from
his chair and crept softly toward the back staircase.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus128.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>The story told by the foreman relates that Colonel Bangs
at the same instant resolved to escape any further persecution,
and he moved off in the direction taken by the poet.
The two met upon the landing, and the colonel was about
<a class="pagenum" id="page_126">[Pg 126]</a>
to begin his quarrel with Slimmer, when an enraged old
woman who had been groping her way up stairs suddenly
plunged her umbrella at Bangs,
and held him in the corner while
she handed a copy of the <i>Argus</i>
to Slimmer, and pointing to a
certain stanza, asked him to
read it aloud. He did so in a
somewhat tremulous voice and
with frightened glances at the
enraged colonel. The verse
was as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>"Little Alexander's dead;</li>
  <li class="i2">Jam him in a coffin;</li>
<li>Don't have as good a chance</li>
  <li class="i2">For a fun'ral often.</li>
<li>Rush his body right around</li>
  <li class="i2">To the cemetery;</li>
<li>Drop him in the sepulchre</li>
  <li class="i2">With his Uncle Jerry."</li>
</ol>

<p>The colonel's assailant accompanied the recitation with
such energetic remarks as these:</p>

<p>"Oh, you willin! D'you hear that, you wretch? What
d'you mean by writin' of my grandson in that way? Take
that, you serpint! Oh, you wiper, you! tryin' to break a
lone widder's heart with such scand'lus lies as them! There,
you willin! I kemmere to hammer you well with this here
umbreller, you owdacious wiper, you! Take that, and that,
you wile, indecent, disgustin' wagabone! When you know
well enough that Aleck never had no Uncle Jerry, and
never had no uncle in no sepulchre anyhow, you wile wretch,
you!"</p>

<p>When Mr. Slimmer had concluded his portion of the entertainment,
he left the colonel in the hands of the enemy
<a class="pagenum" id="page_127">[Pg 127]</a>
and fled. He has not been seen in New Castle since that
day, and it is supposed that he has returned to Sussex county
for the purpose of continuing in private his dalliance with
the Muses. Colonel Bangs appears to have abandoned the
idea of establishing a department of obituary poetry, and
the <i>Argus</i> has resumed its accustomed aspect of dreariness.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>It may fairly boast, however, that once during its career
it has produced a profound impression upon the community.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Bob Parker came home at a very late hour last night;
and when I opened the front door to let him in, he muttered
something to the effect that he was "sorry for being out so
late." Then he pushed by me suddenly and went up stairs
<a class="pagenum" id="page_128">[Pg 128]</a>
in a very odd fashion, keeping his face as much as possible
toward the door, where I remained standing, astonished at
his very strange behavior.
When I closed the door
and went to my room, it
occurred to me that something
of a serious nature
might have happened; and
impelled partly by curiosity
and partly by a desire to be
of service, I knocked at
Bob's door.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus130.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"Anything the matter?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh no. I was detained down town," replied Bob.</p>

<p>"I can't do anything for you, then?"</p>

<p>"No; I'll be in bed in a couple of minutes."</p>

<p>"You acted so peculiarly when you came in that I
thought you might be ill."</p>

<p>"I was never better in my life. I went up stairs that way
because I was tired."</p>

<p>"A very extraordinary effect of fatigue," I said.</p>

<p>"I say!" cried Bob, "don't say anything to your wife
about it. There's no use of getting up an excitement about
nothing."</p>

<p>I went to bed convinced that something was wrong, and
determined to compel Bob to confess on the morrow what it
was. After breakfast we sat smoking together on the porch,
and then I remarked:</p>

<p>"Bob, I wish you to tell me plainly what you meant by
that extraordinary caper on the stairs last night. I think I
ought to know. I don't want to meddle with your private
<a class="pagenum" id="page_129">[Pg 129]</a>
affairs, but it seems to me only the proper thing for you to
give me a chance to advise you if you are in trouble of any
kind. And then you know I am occupying just now a sort
of a parental relation to you, and I want to overhaul you if
you have been doing anything wrong."</p>

<p>"I don't mind explaining the matter to you," replied Bob.
"It don't amount to much, anyhow, but it's a little rough
on a fellow, and I'd rather not have the whole town discussing
it."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You know old Magruder's? Well, I went around there
last night to see Bessie; and as it was a pleasant evening, we
thought we would remain out on the porch. She sat in a
chair near the edge, and I placed myself at her feet on one
of the low wooden steps in front. We stayed there talking
about various things and having a pretty fair time, as a
matter of course, until about nine o'clock, when I said I
thought I'd have to go."</p>

<p>"You came home later, I think."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, some mutton-headed carpenter had
been there during the day mending the rustic chairs on the
porch, and he must have put his glue-pot down on the spot
where I sat, for when I tried to rise I found I couldn't budge."</p>

<p>"You and Cooley's boy seem to have a fondness for that
particular kind of adventure."</p>

<p>"Just so. And when I made an effort to get upon my
feet," Bessie said, 'Don't be in a hurry; it's early yet,' and I
told her I believed I would stay a little while longer. So I
sat there for about two hours, and during the frightful gaps
in the conversation I busied myself thinking how I could
get away without appearing ridiculous. It hurts a man's
chances if he makes himself ridiculous before a woman he is
fond of. So you see I didn't know whether to ask Bessie to
go in the house while I partially disrobed and went home in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_130">[Pg 130]</a>
Highland costume, or whether to give one terrific wrench
and then proceed down the
yard backward.  I couldn't
make up my mind; and as
midnight approached, Bessie,
who was dreadfully sleepy, said,
at last, in utter despair, she
would have to excuse herself
for the rest of the evening."</p>

<p>"Then, you understand, I
was nearly frantic, and I asked
her suddenly if she thought her father would lend me
his front steps for a few days. She looked sort of scared,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_131">[Pg 131]</a>
and went in after old Magruder. When he came out, I
made him stoop down while I explained the situation to
him. He laughed and
hunted up a hatchet and
saw, and cut away the surrounding
timber, so that I
came home with only about
a square foot of wood on
my trousers. Very good of
the old man, wasn't it, to
smash up his steps in that
manner? And the reason
why I kind of sidled up
stairs was that I feared
you'd see that wooden
patch and want to know
about it. That's all. Queer
sort of an affair, wasn't it?"</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus133.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>Then Mr. Parker darted off for the purpose of overtaking
Miss Magruder, who at that moment happened to pass upon
the other side of the street.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As Mr. Parker disappeared, Mrs. Adeler came out upon
the porch from the hall, and placing her hand upon my
shoulder, said,</p>

<p>"You are not going to publish that story of the attempt
of the <i>Argus</i> to establish a department of obituary poetry,
are you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am. Why shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Don't you fear it might perhaps give offence? There
are some people, you know, who think it right to accompany
a notice of death with verses. Besides, does it seem precisely
proper to treat such a solemn subject as death with
so much levity?"</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_132">[Pg 132]</a></p>

<p>"My dear, the persons who use those ridiculous rhymes
which sometimes appear in the papers for the purpose of
parading their grief before the public cannot have very nice
sensibilities."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus134.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"Are you sure of that? At any rate, is it not possible
that a verse which appears to you and me very silly may
be the attempt of some bereaved mother to give in that
forlorn fashion expression to her great agony? I shouldn't
like to ridicule even so wretched a cry from a suffering
heart."</p>

<p>"The suggestion is creditable to your goodness. But I
would like to retain the story of Slimmer's folly, and I'll
<a class="pagenum" id="page_133">[Pg 133]</a>
tell you what I will do: I will publish your opinions upon
the subject, so that those who read the narrative may understand
that the family of Adeler is not wholly careless of
propriety." So here are the story and the protest; and
those to whom the former is offensive may find what consolation
can be obtained from the fact that the latter has been
offered in advance of any expression of opinion by indignant
readers whose grief for the departed tends to run into rhyme.</p>

<p>It is probable that I should never have bought a horse if
I had not been strongly urged to do so by other persons. I
do not care a great deal for riding and driving; and
if it ever did occur to me that it would, perhaps, be
a nice thing to have a horse of my own, I regarded
the necessary expense as much too great for the
small amount of enjoyment that could be obtained
from the investment.
It always seemed to me to be much cheaper to hire
a horse at a livery-stable if only an occasional drive was
desired; and I cling to that theory yet. But everybody else
seemed to think I ought to own a horse. Mrs. Adeler was
especially anxious about it. She insisted that we were doing
very well in the world, and she could not see the use of having
means if we were to live always as we did when we were
<a class="pagenum" id="page_135">[Pg 135]</a>
poor. She said she often wanted to take a little drive along
the river-road in the evening with the children, and she frequently
wished to visit her friends in the country, but she
couldn't bear to go with a strange horse of which she knew
nothing.</p>

<p>My friends used to say, "Adeler, I wonder you don't keep
a horse and take your family out sometimes;" and they
hammered away at the theme until I actually began to feel
as if the public suspected me of being a niggardly and cruel
tyrant, who hugged my gold to my bosom and gloated over
the misery of my wife and children&mdash;gloated because they
couldn't have a horse. People used to come down from the
city to see us, and after examining the house and garden,
they would remark, "Very charming!&mdash;very charming, indeed!
A little paradise, in fact; but, Adeler, why don't you
buy a horse?"</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus137.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>I gradually grew nervous upon the subject, and was tolerably
well convinced that there would never be perfect happiness
in my family until I purchased a steed of some
kind. At last, one day Cooley had a yellow horse
knocked down to him at one of those auction-sales which
are known in the rural districts as "V<i>an</i>dues." And
when I saw Cooley drive
past the house, every afternoon, with that saffron brute, and
his family in a dearborn wagon, and observed how he looked
in at us and smiled superciliously, as if he was thinking,
"There lives a miserable outcast who has no horse and can't
get one," I determined to purchase at once.</p>

<p>I have not had much experience with horses, but I found
one whose appearance and gait were fairly good, and I was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_136">[Pg 136]</a>
particularly drawn toward him because the man recommended
him as being "urbane." I had heard many descriptions
of the points of a good horse, but this was the first
time I had ever met a horse whose most prominent characteristic
was urbanity. It seemed to me that the quality
was an excellent one, and I made a bargain on the spot and
drove home.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus138.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"Mrs. Adeler," I said, as I exhibited the purchase to her,
"I do not think this horse is very fast; I do not regard him
as in the highest sense beautiful; he may even be deficient
in wind; his tail certainly is short; and I think I can detect
in his forelegs a tendency to spring too far forward at the
knees; but, Mrs. Adeler, the horse is urbane. The man
said that his urbanity amounted to a positive weakness, and
that is why I bought him. If a horse is not urbane, my
dear, it is useless, no matter what its merit in other respects."</p>

<p>She said that had been her opinion from early childhood.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_137">[Pg 137]</a></p>

<p>"I do not care greatly, Mrs. Adeler, for excessive speed.
Give me a horse that can proceed with merely a tolerable
degree of celerity and I am content. I never could comprehend
why a man whose horse can trot a mile in two minutes
and forty seconds should be made unhappy because another
man's horse trots the same distance one second sooner&mdash;that
is, of course, supposing that they are not running for money.
One second of time never makes any especial difference to
me, even when I am in a hurry. What I want in a horse
is not swiftness, but urbanity. I would rather have a kind-hearted
horse, like ours, than the most rapid trotter with a
wicked disposition."</p>

<p>For a while I enjoyed having a horse, and I felt glad I
had bought him. It seemed very good to drive down by the
river-bank upon a pleasant evening, with the cool breeze
blowing in from the water, and the country around beautiful
with the bright foliage of early autumn. There was a sufficient
compensation for the heat and wretchedness of the
busy day in that quiet journey over the level road and past
the fragrant fields in the early twilight; and as we came
home amid the deepening shadows, we could find pleasure
in watching the schooners far off in the channel flinging out
their lights, and we could see the rays streaming across the
wide interval of rippling surface, and moving weirdly and
strangely with the motion of the water.</p>

<p>Sometimes, upon going out, we would overtake Cooley in
his dearborn; and then it was felicitous to observe how,
when I touched my horse with the whip, the animal put his
head down, elevated his abbreviated tail to a horizontal position
and left Cooley far, far behind, flogging his tawny horse
with such fury as would surely have subjected him to the reproaches
of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals if that excellent organization had been present.
My horse could achieve a tolerably rapid gait when he desired
<a class="pagenum" id="page_138">[Pg 138]</a>
to do so. That fact made existence in this world of
anguish and tears seem even more sad to Cooley than it had
done previously. I feel sure that he would have given fabulous
sums if his horse could have trotted a mile in a minute&mdash;just
once&mdash;when we were upon the road together. I began
to think that it was just as well, after all, to have a progressive
horse as a slow one.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus140.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>But when the novelty of the thing had passed, my old
indisposition to amusement of that kind gradually returned.
I drove less frequently. One day my man said to me:</p>

<p>"Mr. Adeler, that hoss is a-eatin' his head off, sir. If you
don't take him out, he'll be so wild that he'll bu'st the machine
to flinders, sir."</p>

<p>The threatened catastrophe seemed so alarming that I
took him out, although I had important work to do at home.
The next day I wanted to stay up in the city to go to a lecture;
but that morning, early, the horse again displayed an
alarming amount of friskiness, and I felt as if I must go
down and exercise him. I drove him for three hours at a
rapid gait, and succeeded in working off at least the exuberance
of his spirits.</p>

<p>On the following Wednesday I came home in the afternoon,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_139">[Pg 139]</a>
exhausted with work, and intending to retire at an
early hour. At half-past six o'clock, Judge Pitman came
in. He remarked:</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus141.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"Adeler, that horse of yourn'll certainly go crazy if you
don't move him around. Mind me. He kicks like a flintlock
musket now if you come within forty foot
of the stable."</p>

<p>I went out and hitched up, and that night
I drove twenty-four miles at a frightful speed.
Horses have, perhaps, gone farther and faster,
but few have been pushed forward with a smaller regard for
consequences. Nothing but a recollection of the cost of the
horse restrained me from driving him into the river and
leaving him there.</p>

<p>By degrees the despicable brute became the curse of my
existence. If I desired to go on a journey, the restlessness
of the horse had first to be overcome. If I received an invitation
to a party, the horse must be exercised beforehand.
If I had an important article to write, I must roam around
the country behind that horse for two or three hours, holding
him in with such force that my hands were made too
unsteady for penmanship. If I wanted to take a row on
the river&mdash;an exercise of which I am passionately fond&mdash;that
detestable animal had to be danced up and down the
turnpike in order to keep him from kicking the stable to
pieces. And he was recommended to me as "urbane"!</p>

<p>He made my life unhappy. I became depressed and
morose. Sometimes when, amid a circle of friends, there
was a provocation to laughter, and I participated in the general
hilarity, I would suddenly become conscious of the fact
that the horse was in active existence, and the mirth would
be extinguished in gloom. He mingled with my dreams.
Visions of a bob-tailed horse consuming spectral oats, and
kicking with millions of legs, disturbed my rest at night. I
<a class="pagenum" id="page_140">[Pg 140]</a>
rushed with him over countless leagues of shadowy road, and
plunged with him over incomprehensible precipices. He
organized himself into hideous nightmare shapes, and
charged wildly over me as I slept, and filled all the air of
that mysterious slumber-land with the noise of his demoniac
neighing.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
><img src="images/illus142.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>The reality was bad enough without the unreal nocturnal
horrors. I might have sold the brute, but my wife really
wanted to have a horse, and I wished to oblige her. But it
was very wearing to hear about constantly the feeling of responsibility
which the animal engendered. I had to choose
between driving him continually and having the lives of the
members of my family imperiled when they took him out;
and the consciousness that whether there was sickness or
business, storm or earthquake, calamity or death, the horse
must be driven, gradually placed me in the position of a
man who is haunted by some dreadful spectre that clings to
him and overshadows him for ever and for ever.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_141">[Pg 141]</a></p>

<p>The perpetual nervous worry told upon me. I became
thin. My clothing hung loose upon me. I took up two
inches in my waistcoat strap. The appetite which enabled me to find
enjoyment at the table deserted me. The food seemed tasteless; and if
in the midst of a meal the neigh of the horse came eddying up through
the air from the stable, I turned away with a feeling of disgust, and
felt as if I wanted to prod somebody with the carving-knife.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus143.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>One day my wife said to me:</p>

<p>"Mr. Adeler, you know that I urged you strongly to buy
that horse, and I thought he would do, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But now you want to sell him! ha! ha!" I exclaimed,
with delight. "Very well, I'll send him to the auctioneer
this very day."</p>

<p>"I wasn't going to say that," she remarked. "What I
wanted to mention was that nearly everybody in good circumstances
about here drives a pair, and I think we ought
to get another horse; don't you, my dear? It's so much
nicer than having only one."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Adeler," I said, solemnly, "that one horse down
there in the stable has reduced me to a skeleton and made
me utterly miserable. I will do as you say if you insist
upon it, but I tell you plainly that if another horse is
brought upon these premises I shall go mad."</p>

<p>"Don't speak in that manner, my dear."</p>

<p>"I tell you, Mrs. Adeler, that I shall go stark, staring
mad! Take your choice: go without the other horse or
have a maniac husband."</p>

<p>She said, of course, she would do without the horse.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus144a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>But the affliction was suddenly and unexpectedly removed
<a class="pagenum" id="page_142">[Pg 142]</a>
My horse had a singularly brief tail, and I thought it might
be that some of his violent demonstrations in the stable were
induced by his inability to switch off the flies which alighted
upon sensitive portions of the body. It occurred to me to
get him up an artificial tail for home use, and I procured
a piece of thick rope for the purpose. There was,
too, a certain humorousness about the idea that pleased
me; and as the
amount of jocularity which that horse had occasioned had,
thus far, been particularly small, the notion had peculiar
attractiveness.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus144b.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>I unraveled about eighteen inches of the rope and fastened
the other end to the horse's tail. This, I estimated,
would enable him to switch a fly off the very end of his nose
when he had acquired a little practice. Unfortunately, I
neglected to speak to my man upon the subject; and
when he came to the stable that evening, he examined the rope
and concluded that I was trying experiments with
some new kind of hitching-strap; so he tied the horse to the
stall by the artificial continuation. By morning the feed-box
was kicked into kindling-wood, and the horse was standing
<a class="pagenum" id="page_143">[Pg 143]</a>
on three legs, with the other leg caught in the hay-rack,
while he had chewed up two of the best boards in the side of
the stable in front of him.</p>

<p>Subsequently I explained the theory to the man and readjusted
the rope. But the patent tail annoyed the hostler
so much while currying the horse that he tied a stone to it
to hold it still. The consequence was that in a moment of
unusual excitement the horse flung the stone around and
inflicted a severe wound upon the man's head. The man
resigned next morning.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus145.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>I then concluded to introduce an improvement. I purchased
some horse-hair and spliced it upon the tail so neatly
that it had the appearance of a natural growth. When the new
man came, he attempted to comb out the horse's tail, and the added
portion came off in his hand. He had profound confidence in
his veterinary skill, and he imagined that the occurrence indicated
a diseased condition of the horse. So he purchased some
powders and gave the animal an enormous dose in a bucket of
warm "mash." In half an hour that pestilential horse was seized
with convulsions, during which
he kicked out the stable-door, shattered the stall to pieces,
hammered four more boards out of the partition, dislocated
his off hind leg and expired in frightful agony.</p>

<p>He was more urbane after death than he had been during
his life, and I contemplated his remains without shedding a
tear. He was sold to a glue-man for eight dollars; and when
he had departed, I felt that he would fulfill a wiser and better
<a class="pagenum" id="page_144">[Pg 144]</a>
purpose as a contributor to the national stock of glue than
as the unconscious persecutor of his former owner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Mrs. Adeler, do you feel any interest in the subject of
pirates?"</p>

<p>She said the question was somewhat abrupt, but she
thought she might safely say she did not.</p>

<p>"I make the inquiry for the reason that I have just written
a ballad which has for its hero a certain bold corsair.
This is the first consequence of the death of our horse. In
the exuberance of joy caused by that catastrophe, I felt as
if I would like to perpetrate something which should be
purely ridiculous, and accordingly I organized upon paper
this piratical narrative. You think the subject is an odd
one? Not so. I do not pretend to explain the fact, but it
is true that by this generation a pirate is regarded as a comic personage.
Perhaps the reason is that he has been so often presented
to us in such a perfectly absurd form in melodrama and in the
cheap and trashy novels of the day. At any rate, he is susceptible of
humorous treatment, as you will perceive."</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus146.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"I have had a stronger impulse to write of buccaneers, too, because
I am in New Castle; for, somehow, I always associate those freebooting
individuals with this village. A certain ancestor of
mine sailed away from this town in 1813, in a brig commissioned
as a privateer, and played havoc with the ships of
the enemy upon the Atlantic. In my childhood I used to
hear of his brave deeds, and, somehow, I conceived the idea
<a class="pagenum" id="page_145">[Pg 145]</a>
that he was a genuine pirate with a black flag, skull and
cross-bones, and a disagreeable habit of compelling his captives
to walk the plank. I was much more proud of him
then, Mrs. Adeler, than I should be now had he really been
such a ruffian. But he was not. He was a gallant sailor
and a brave and honest gentleman, who served his country
faithfully on the ocean, and then held a post of honor as
warden of the port of Philadelphia until his death. But I
never go to the river's side in New Castle without involuntarily
recalling that fine old man in the character of an outlawed
rover upon the high seas.</p>

<p>"Here, my dear, is the ballad. When I have read it to
you, I will send it to the <i>Argus</i>. Since Mr. Slimmer's retirement
there has been a dearth of poetry in the columns of that
great organ."</p>

<ol>
<li>A sanguinary pirate sailed upon the Spanish main</li>
<li>In a rakish-looking schooner which was called the "Mary Jane."</li>
<li>She carried lots of howitzers and deadly rifled guns,</li>
<li>With shot and shell and powder and percussion caps in tons.</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>The pirate was a homely man, and short and grum and fat;</li>
<li>He wore a wild and awful scowl beneath his slouching hat.</li>
<li>Swords, pistols and stilettos were arranged around his thighs,</li>
<li>And demoniacal glaring was quite common with his eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>His heavy black moustaches curled away beneath his nose,</li>
<li>And drooped in elegant festoons about his very toes.</li>
<li>He hardly ever spoke at all; but when such was the case,</li>
<li>His voice 'twas easy to perceive was quite a heavy bass.</li>
</ol>

<ol><li><a class="pagenum" id="page_146">[Pg 146]</a></li>
<li>He was not a serious pirate; and despite his anxious cares,</li>
<li>He rarely went to Sunday-school and seldom said his prayers.</li>
<li>He worshiped lovely women, and his hope in life was this:</li>
<li>To calm his wild, tumultuous soul with pure domestic bliss.</li>

<li>When conversing with his shipmates, he very often swore</li>
  <li>That he longed to give up piracy and settle down on shore.</li>
<li>He tired of blood and plunder; of the joys that they could bring;</li>
  <li>He sighed to win the love of some affectionate young thing.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>One morning as the "Mary Jane" went bounding o'er the sea</li>
  <li>The pirate saw a merchant bark far off upon his lee.</li>
<li>He ordered a pursuit, and spread all sail that he could spare,</li>
  <li>And then went down, in hopeful mood, to shave and curl his hair.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>He blacked his boots and pared his nails and tied a fresh cravat;</li>
  <li>He cleansed his teeth, pulled down his cuffs and polished up his hat;</li>
<li>He dimmed with flour the radiance of his fiery red nose,</li>
  <li>For, hanging with that vessel's wash, <i>he saw some ladies' hose.</i></li>

  <li>Made all the ship vociferous with her outrageous screams.</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>But when the pirate's message came, she dried her streaming tears,</li>

<p>There are but few old villages in the United States
that contain ancient churches so picturesque in situation
and in appearance as that which stands in the centre
of our town, the most conspicuous of its buildings.
The churchyard is filled with graves, for the people still
cling to that kindly usage which places the sacred
dust of the departed in holy ground. And so here, beneath
the trees, and close to
the shadow of the sanctuary walls, villagers of all ages and
generations lie reposing in their final slumber, while from
among them the snow-white spire rises heavenward to point
the way their souls have gone. There are many of us who
were not born here, and who are, as it were, almost strangers
in the town, who can wander down the narrow paths of the
yard, to out-of-the-way corners, where the headstones are
gray with age and sometimes covered with a film of moss,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_153">[Pg 153]</a>
and read in the quaint characters with which the marble is
inscribed our own family names. Here lies the mortal part
of men and women who were dear to our
grandsires; of little children too, sometimes,
whose departure brought sorrow to the
hearts of those who joined them in Paradise
long, long before we began to play our parts
in the drama of existence. The lives that
ended in this quiet resting-place are full of
deepest interest to us; they have a controlling
influence upon our destiny, and yet
they are very unreal to us. The figures
which move by us as we try to summon up
the panorama of that past are indistinct
and obscure. They are shadows walking in
the dusk, and we strive in vain to vest them
with a semblance of the personality which
once was theirs. They should seem very
near to us their kindred, and yet, as we
attempt to come closer to them, they appear
so remote, so far away in the dead years,
that we hardly dare to claim fellowship with them, or to
speak of them as of our flesh and blood.</p>

<p>It makes no difference where the empty shell is cast when
the spiritual man is gone, but I reverence that human
instinct which induces a man to wish to be laid at the last
by the side of his ancestors and near to those whom he has
loved in life. It is at least a beautiful sentiment which
demands that those who are with each other in immortality
should not be separated here on earth, but together should
await the morning of the resurrection.</p>

<p>I like this old church for its simplicity; not only for the
absence of splendor in its adornment, but for the methods
of worship of which it approves. The choir, from its station
<a class="pagenum" id="page_154">[Pg 154]</a>
in the organ-loft, never hurls down upon the heads of the
saints and sinners beneath any of those surprising sounds
which rural choirs so often emit, with a conviction that they
are achieving wonderful feats of vocalism, and no profane
fingers compel the pipes of the microscopic organ to recall
to the mind of the listener the music of the stage and the
concert-room. From the instrument come only harmonies
round, sweet and full, melting in solemn cadences from key
to key and rolling down through the church, bringing the
souls of the worshipers into full accord with the spirit of
the place and the occasion, or else pouring forth some
stately melody on which the voices of the singers are
upborne. The choir fulfills its highest purpose by leading
the people through the measures of those grand old tunes,
simple in construction but sublime in spirit, which give
to the language of the spiritual songs of the sanctuary
a more eloquent beauty than their own. I would
rather hear such music as may be found in "Federal
Street," in "Old Hundred," in "Hursley" and in the
"Adeste Fideles," sung by an entire assembly of people
who are in earnest in their religion, than to listen to the most
intricate fugue worked out by a city choir of hired singers, or
the most brilliant anthem sung by a congregation of surpliced
boys who quarrel with each other and play wicked games
during the prayers. Such tunes as these are filled with solemn
meaning which is revealed to him whose singing is really an
act of worship. There is more genuine religious fervor in
"Hursley" than in a library of ordinary oratorios. A
<a class="pagenum" id="page_155">[Pg 155]</a>
<a class="pagenum" id="page_156">[Pg 156]</a>
<a class="pagenum" id="page_157">[Pg 157]</a>
church which permits its choir to do all the singing might
as well adopt the Chinese fashion of employing a machine
to do its praying. A congregation
which sits still while a quartette
of vocalists overhead utters all
the praises, need not hesitate to
offer its supplications by turning
a brass wheel with a crank. Our
people do their singing and their
praying for themselves, and the
choir merely takes care that the
music is of a fitting kind.</p>

<p>Miss Magruder sits in the organ-loft now that she is at
home, and I doubt not she contributes much to the sweetness
of the strains which float from out that somewhat narrow
enclosure. Her presence, I observe, ensures the regular
attendance of young Mr. Parker at the church, and last Sunday
he even ventured to sit with the choir and to help with
the singing. I have never considered him a really good performer,
although he cherishes a conviction that he has an
admirable voice, and such acquaintance with the art of
using it as would have given him eminence if he had chosen
the career of a public singer. After service I had occasion
to speak to the clergyman for a moment, and as soon as he
saw me he said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Adeler, did you notice anything about the organ or
the choir to-day that was peculiar?"</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus159b.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"No; I do not think I did."</p>

<p>"It is very odd; but it seemed to me
when they were singing the two last hymns
that something must be the matter with one
of the pipes. There was a sort of a rough,
buzzing, rasping sound which I have never observed before.
The instrument must need repairing."</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_158">[Pg 158]</a></p>

<p>"I think I know what it was," remarked Mr. Campbell,
the basso, who stepped up at that moment.</p>

<p>"The valves a little worn, I suppose?" said the minister.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus160a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Well, no," replied Campbell; "the fact is
that extraordinary noise was produced by Mr.
Parker, who was making a strenuous effort to
sing bass. He seemed to be laboring under a
strong conviction that the composers had made
some mistakes in the tunes, which he proposed to correct as
he went along. Parker's singing is like hom&oelig;opathic medicine&mdash;a
very little of it is enough."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus160b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Bob attributes the criticism of Campbell to professional
jealousy, but he will probably sit down stairs after this.
He prefers not to waste his talents upon provincial people
who cannot appreciate genuine art. He will content himself
with walking home with the fair Magruder after service.</p>

<p>There is one thing about the church with which I must
<a class="pagenum" id="page_159">[Pg 159]</a>
find fault. I have never been able to comprehend why it is
customary throughout this country, even in the large cities, to
permit undertakers to decorate the exteriors of churches with
their advertisements, as ours is decorated by our undertaker.
In old times, when the sexton was the grave-digger and
general public functionary, it was well enough to give publicity
to his residence by posting its whereabouts in a public
place. There were oftentimes little offices which he had to
perform for the congregation and for the neighborhood, and
it was necessary that he should be found quickly. But the
present fashion, which allows an undertaker&mdash;who has no
other connection with the church than that he sits in a pew
occasionally and goes to sleep during the
sermon&mdash;to nail a tin sign, bearing a picture
of a gilt coffin, right by the church door, so
that no man, woman or child can enter that
sanctuary without thinking of the grave, is monstrous.</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus161.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>It is very proper that the minds of the people should be
turned to contemplation of the certainty of death whenever
they go to church. But it is hardly necessary to disturb a
man's reflections upon the necessity of preparing for the
grave by confronting him with an advertisement which compels
him to remember how much it is going to cost his relations
to put him there. Besides this, it makes the undertakers
covetous, and fills their gloomy souls with murderous
wishes.</p>

<p>I have seen ours standing against the wall in the churchyard
on a Sunday morning with his hands in his pockets,
glowering at the congregation as they go in, eyeing and
criticising the members, and muttering to himself, "Splendid
fit <i>he'd</i> make in that mahogany coffin I've got at home!"
"There goes a man who ought to have died five years ago
if <i>I'd</i> been treated right!" "I'll souse that Thompson underground
<a class="pagenum" id="page_160">[Pg 160]</a>
some of these fine days!" "Those Mulligan girls
<i>certainly</i> can't give the old man anything less than a four-hundred-dollar
funeral when <i>he</i> dies!" "Healthiest looking
congregation of its size <i>I ever</i> saw!" etc., etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus162.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>If I were in authority in the church, I would suppress
that gilded advertisement and try to convert the owner of it.
No man should be permitted to waste his Sabbaths in vain
longings for the interment of his fellow-men.</p>

<p>They are very busy now at the church putting in new
furnaces in order to be prepared for the cold weather. New
ones were introduced last winter, I am told, but they were
not entirely successful in operation. The first time the fire
was put in them was on Saturday morning, and on Sunday
<a class="pagenum" id="page_161">[Pg 161]</a>
the smoke was so dense in the church that nobody could see
the clergyman. The workman had put the stove-pipe into
the hot-air flue. Next Saturday night the fires were lighted,
out on Sunday morning only the air immediately under the
roof was warm, and the congregation nearly froze to death.
The sexton was then instructed to make the fire on Thursday, in
order to give the church a chance to become thoroughly heated.
He did so, and early Sunday morning the furnaces were so
choked up with ashes that the fires went out, and again the
thermometer in the front pew marked zero.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus163a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus163b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Then the sexton received orders to make that fire on Thursday,
and to watch it carefully until church-time on the following
Sabbath. He did so, and both furnaces were in full
blast at the appointed hour. That was the only warm
Sunday we had last winter. The mercury was up to eighty
degrees out of doors, while in the church everybody was in
a profuse perspiration, and the bellows-blower at the organ
fainted twice. The next Sunday the sexton tried to keep
the fires low by pushing in the dampers, and consequently
the church was filled with coal-gas, and the choir couldn't
<a class="pagenum" id="page_162">[Pg 162]</a>
sing, nor could the minister preach without coughing between
his sentences.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus164a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Subsequently the sexton removed one of the cast-iron
registers in the floor for the purpose of examining the hot-air
flue. He left the hole open while he went into the cellar
for a moment, and just then old Mr. Collamer came
in to hunt for his gloves, which he thought he had left in
his pew. Of course he walked directly into
the opening, and was dragged out in a condition
of asphyxia. That very day one of the
furnaces burst and nearly fired the church.
The demand for heaters of another kind seemed
to be imperative.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus164b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Old Collamer, by the way, is singularly unfortunate in
his experiences in the sanctuary. He is extremely deaf, and
a few Sundays ago he made a fearful blunder during the
sermon. The clergyman had occasion to introduce a quotation,
and as it was quite long, he brought the volume with
him; and when the time came, he picked up the book and
began to read from it. We
always sing the Old Hundred
doxology after sermon at our
church, and Mr. Collamer, seeing
the pastor with the book,
thought the time had come, so
while the minister was reading;
he opened his hymn-book at
the place. Just as the clergyman
laid the volume down the
man sitting next to Mr. Collamer
began to yawn, and Mr.
Collamer, thinking he was about to sing, immediately broke
out into Old Hundred, and roared it at the top of his voice.
As the clergyman was just beginning "secondly," and as
<a class="pagenum" id="page_163">[Pg 163]</a>
there was of course perfect silence in the church, the effect
of Mr. Collamer's vociferation was very startling. But the
good old man failed to notice that anything was the matter,
so he kept right on and sang the verse through.</p>

<p>When he had finished, he observed that everybody else
seemed to be quiet, excepting a few who were laughing, so
he leaned over and said out loud to the man who yawned,</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus165a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"What's the matter with this congregation, anyhow? Why don't they go home?"</p>

<p>The man turned scarlet, and the perspiration broke out all
over him, for he felt that the eyes of the congregation were
upon him, and he knew that he would have to yell to make
Mr. Collamer hear. So he touched his lips with his fingers
as a sign for the old man to keep quiet. But Mr. Collamer
misunderstood the motion:</p>

<p>"Goin' to sing another hymn, hey? All right."</p>

<p>And he began to fumble his hymn-book again. Then the
sexton hurried up the aisle, and explained matters out loud
to Mr. Collamer, and that gentleman subsided, while the
minister proceeded with his discourse. The clergyman has
written Mr. Collamer a note requesting him in the future
not to join in the sacred harmony. The effect is too appalling
upon the ribald boys in the back pews.</p>

<p>It is said that there is good fishing in this vicinity. Several
of my neighbors who have been out lately have
brought home large quantities of fish of various
kinds, together with glowing reports of the delightful character
of the sport. A craving to indulge in this form of amusement was gradually
excited in the mind of Mr. Bob Parker by the stories
of the anglers and by the display of their trophies, and he
succeeded in persuading me to assist in the organization
of an expedition down the river to the fishing-grounds.
Yesterday was selected for the undertaking. I hired a boat
from a man at the wharf; and after packing a generous
luncheon in the fish-basket and securing a box full of bait,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_165">[Pg 165]</a>
we tossed our lines into the boat, together with a heavy
stone which was to serve as an anchor, and then we pushed
out into the stream.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus167a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus167b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>It was early morning when we started, and to my dismay
I found that the tide was running up with remarkable
velocity. As we had to pull four miles down the river, this
was a consideration of very great importance. Mr. Parker
is not an especially skillful oarsman, and before he had fairly
seated himself and dipped his blade in the water we had
drifted two hundred yards in the wrong direction. After
very severe labor for half an hour, we succeeded in getting
three-quarters of a mile below the town, and then Bob
informed me that he thought he could row better with my
oar. Accordingly,
I changed places
with him, and during
the time thus
expended the boat
went back a third
of the distance we
had gained. Another prolonged and terrible effort enabled
us to proceed two miles toward our destination, and then
Parker observed that he must stop and rest; he said he
would die if he rowed another stroke. So we lay upon our
oars for a while, and embraced the opportunity to wipe
away the perspiration and to cool our blistered hands in the
river. Parker then asked me if I would mind changing
places with him again. He said he was now convinced that
<a class="pagenum" id="page_166">[Pg 166]</a>
he had made a mistake in leaving his first position. We
fell back half a mile during this period; and when we finally
reached the grounds, the morning was far advanced. Bob
was nearly worn out,
and he proposed that
we give up the idea of
catching fish and row
ashore, where we could
lie down under the trees
and begin operations
upon the luncheon.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus168a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>But as we had come
to fish, I was determined to do so. I informed Bob that I
should be ashamed to go home without bringing any game.
I should be afraid to look in the face of the man who owned
the boat when he asked me what luck I had. So we tied
a rope around the stone, and tossing the stone overboard, we
came to anchor. Our
hooks were baited and
the lines were thrown
out, and then Bob and
I waited patiently for
bites.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus168b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus168c.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>It required a great
deal of patience, for the
fish did not take the
bait with a remarkable degree of freedom. In fact, we
only had a nibble or two at first, and then even this manifestation
of the presence of the fish ceased.
We were sitting with our backs to the shore,
watching the corks in front of us, when Bob
suddenly uttered an exclamation. Upon looking
around, I found that we had drifted half
a mile up stream and out into the middle of the river, which
<a class="pagenum" id="page_167">[Pg 167]</a>
is here nearly four miles wide. The stone had dropped
from the knot in the rope and released the boat.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus169a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus169b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Then we rowed back to shore and landed for the purpose
of obtaining another stone. We could not find one,
so we pulled out again; and sticking one of the oars
in the mud, we fastened the
boat to that. Then Bob had a
bite. He pulled up, and dragged
to the surface of the water a
crab, which instantly let go and
sidled under the
boat. Then we each
caught a small sunfish,
and with this
our enthusiasm began
to revive. Just then the
oar came out of the mud, slipped
through the loop in the cable and floated off. The prospect
of having to take the boat
home with one oar seemed
so appalling that I hastily
threw off my coat and shoes
and swam after the fugitive
oar. Meantime, the boat floated
off, and I reached it and was
hauled in by Bob just as I had
made up my mind to give up
and go to the bottom.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus169c.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>We then fastened the oar down again, and I held it with
one hand and my fishing-line with the other. Suddenly each
of us had a splendid bite, and we both pulled in vigorously.
The fish seemed to struggle violently all the way to the
surface; but when the hooks came into view, we found
that our lines were entangled, and that neither of us had a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_168">[Pg 168]</a>
fish. The next time Bob attempted to take in his line his
hook caught upon the bottom; and when, in a fit of exasperation,
he tried to
jerk it loose, the cord
snapped and the hopes
of the fisherman were
blasted for that day.
Then, as Bob tipped
the boat while he washed
his hands, the bait-box
fell overboard, and
so matters came to a
definite conclusion, and we determined to quit.</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illus170a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>When we started for home, the tide had turned, and we
did not reach town until dark. The man who owned the
craft had just telegraphed to Delaware City for the purpose
of ascertaining if two suspicious
men had landed
there and attempted to sell
a boat. He compelled me
to pay half a day's hire extra
for staying out so late,
together with the cost of the
telegram.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus170b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>I consider it beneath me
to notice the unnecessary
violence of his language or
the insolence of his criticisms
upon our skill as fishermen.</p>

<p>This I could have borne
with patience, but it was hard, very, very hard, upon arriving
home, to have Mrs. Adeler come to the door with a
smile upon her face and ask, "Where are the fish?" while
<a class="pagenum" id="page_169">[Pg 169]</a>
she informed us that she had asked the Magruders over
to tea, and had depended upon us to supply the principal
dish, so that now she had not a thing in the house that she
could cook.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Adeler, we return with two diminutive sunfish,
one demoralized ham-sandwich, two crimson noses and a
thorough, sincere, whole-souled and earnest disgust for the
wretched business which some men choose to regard in the
light of amusement, No, Mrs. Adeler, we have no fish that
are worthy of the name, and hereafter when
we wish to have some, we will purchase them
from the unhappy beings who catch them. A
fisherman deserves all the money he can get,
my dear. I wouldn't be a professional piscator
for the mines of Golconda and the wealth of a nabob to
boot."</p>

<p>Our unfortunate experiences upon the river tempt me to
refer in detail to the ills to which amateur fishermen, as a
class, are exposed. The pleasures of angling have been said
and sung by a vast multitude of sentimental people reaching
all the way from old Izaak Walton to Mr. Prime; but the
story of the suffering that too often accompanies the sport
has not yet been narrated with a sufficient amount of vigor.
The martyr fishermen have been too long kept in the background.
The time has come for them to have a hearing. I
have chosen to present their complaint in the somewhat
singular form of a letter to Mr. Benjamin F. Butler, because
at the time of the negotiation of the Washington treaty he
manifested much indignation at the wrongs heaped upon
American fishermen by that instrument, and because he is
a very suitable person to figure in a remonstrance which has
about it perhaps a slight flavor of burlesque, even though it
is a narrative of real misery.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Sorrows of the Fisherman.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear General</span>: I have given a great deal of reflection,
lately, to the fishery question, and I am convinced that your
opposition to the fishery clauses of the Washington treaty
had a basis of sound common sense. The treaty, in my
opinion, wholly fails to consider in a spirit of wise statesmanship
the causes which move the fisherman to complaint,
and supplies no adequate means for securing their removal.
Permit me to suggest to you the propriety of urging upon the
government the reassembling of the joint high commission
for the purpose of obtaining a reconsideration of the fishery
question with the new light which I propose to shed upon it.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus172.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>My experience in fishing has convinced me that one of the
most serious of the primary obstacles to be overcome is the
difficulty of procuring worms. Perhaps you may have observed
an enthusiastic fisherman in pursuit of worms? The
day is always warm, and his performance upon the shovel
conduces to profuse perspiration. He seems never to strike
precisely the spot where the worms frolic. He labors with
tremendous energy until he has excavated a couple of cellars
and a rifle-pit, from which he rescues but two or three worms,
while all around him the earth is perforated with holes, into
which other vermicular creatures
are perceived to disappear
before he can lay his hands on
them. The alacrity with which
a worm draws himself into a
hole in the ground, and dives
down apparently to the centre
of the globe, when you want
him, is a constant source of
aggravation to the fisherman. The fishery interests suffer on
account of it.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_171">[Pg 171]</a></p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus173a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>If a joint high commission would address itself in a conciliatory
spirit to the work of obtaining concerted action
from the civilized nations of the world upon the
subject of the reformation of worms, blessed
results would undoubtedly accrue. I know a
fisherman who could make a speech in Congress
on the subject of worms which would make that
body weep the rotunda full of tears.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus173b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>And even when bait has been secured, you are aware,
perhaps, that the fisherman will sit for hours upon the bank
of the stream watching his cork
until he is nearly blinded, and
until his head swims. At last,
when his patience is exhausted
and he is convinced that there
are no fish about, he pulls up
for the purpose of trying another
spot, and finds that some disreputable
fish has sucked the bait
off the hook an hour before
without making a perceptible nibble.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus173c.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Perhaps a clause in the treaty
upon the general subject of nibbles might be of service. I
think a paragraph could be constructed on nibbles which
would create more amazement and produce a
greater sensational effect in diplomatic circles
than anything that ever appeared in a treaty.
The introduction of the subject of nibbles to international
law would give that science refreshing
variety and probably prevent devastating wars.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus174.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>It is another cause of suffering to the fisherman that when
he has thrown in again, and has waited an hour for a bite,
and waited in vain, he considers it safe to drop his rod for a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_172">[Pg 172]</a>
moment, so that he can light his pipe. It is a peculiar circumstance,
I say, that just as he
has struck his last match he always
gets the most vigorous bite
of the whole day. The cork pulls
under in the most exciting manner
several times, and only floats
up again permanently at the moment
when the angler seizes his
rod in eager haste and finds that
the fish is gone.</p>

<p>It is this kind of thing that
makes the fisherman feel as if he
would be relieved by the use of
violent language. The British
premier, I am sure, will consent to the negotiation of another
treaty if you will press this matter on him. He must see at
once that unless bites are arranged with a greater regard for
the feelings of the fisherman and for the sanctity of the law
against profane swearing, the fishery interests will languish
and the crop prove a humiliating failure.</p>

<p>I have often remarked, too, that when the fisherman has
nearly landed a fish, which drops off the hook just as it appears
to be safe, he collects all his energies for the next bite.
He grasps the rod tightly with both hands, he rises and
plants his legs firmly upon the ground, he watches the cork
carefully, with his lips compressed and with fiery determination
gleaming from his eyes. The cork moves slightly. It
goes under; he has a good bite; he pulls up with frightful
energy, determined not to lose this one, and the next instant
his line hits the limb of the tree overhead, and winds
around it as closely as if it was put there on purpose to
splice that limb, so as to make it perfectly secure throughout
the unending ages of eternity.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_173">[Pg 173]</a></p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus175.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>I always excuse the man for taking a gloomy view of
life, and for saying over with ardor and vehemence his entire
reserve stock of objurgations
as he shins up the tree.
But has the government no
duty in the matter? What
is the use of joint high commissions
if these things are
to be allowed? We have
made the republic successful,
we have fought mighty battles,
we have paid millions
of indebtedness and we have
given the civilization of the
world a tremendous impulse
forward; now let us do something
for the disgusted fisherman
who has to fumble
around out on that limb. Let us have a special treaty on
that particular branch of the subject.</p>

<p>If something could be done in relation to eels, I think the
government of our beloved country would rest upon a foundation
of greater stability and have a more permanent hold
upon popular affection. Perhaps you have fished for eels?
The eel gently pulls the cork under and lets go. You pull
up suddenly, and throw in again. The eel tenderly draws
the cork beneath the surface, and, wild with fury, you jerk
out your line a second time. This exhilarating exercise continues
for some moments, and you make up your mind that
existence will be a burden, the world a hollow sham, and
groceries and marketing useless baubles, unless you catch
that eel. Finally you do hook him and draw him out. He
is active, playful and vivacious. He wriggles; he forms
himself in quick succession into S's, C's and Q's. He points
<a class="pagenum" id="page_174">[Pg 174]</a>
to all the four quarters of the compass at once. He swallows
himself and spits himself out. He wraps himself
around your boot and shoots up
your leg and covers your trowsers
with slime, and tangles your
line into a mess by the side of
which the Gordian knot was the
perfection of simplicity.
When you get
your foot firmly on
him, you find that he
has swallowed the
hook, and you have to cut him
completely open, from head to
tail, to get the hook out, and
then, as likely as not, the eel will
flip back into the water and escape. I think eels rarely die.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus176a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus176b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>A joint high commission which would devote itself with
philanthropic ardor and untiring energy to a dispassionate
consideration of the subject of the immortality of eels might,
perhaps, achieve important results. Any settlement of the
fishery question which overlooked the hideous wickedness of
eels would be a cruel mockery of human woe.</p>

<p>But for pure pathos, I can conceive of nothing that will
equal the anguish of the fisherman when he imagines he has
a catfish upon his hook. His cork is drawn slowly under
the surface, and it goes down, down, down, until it sinks completely
out of sight. He is certain it is a catfish&mdash;they always
pull in this manner, he says; and he draws in his line
gently, while the fish tugs and pulls at the other end.
Gradually, v-e-r-y gradually, the fisherman pulls it in, in
order to be sure to keep the prey upon the hook. It is
evidently a very large fish, and he is determined to land
it through the shallow water, so that it cannot drop back
<a class="pagenum" id="page_175">[Pg 175]</a>
and escape. Slowly it comes up, and just as the hook nears
the surface the angler gives a sudden jerk, and out comes a
terrific snag with a dozen branches
and covered with mud. And
meanwhile, during all the fisherman's
troubles, there is that infamous
small boy sitting on the opposite
bank of the creek pulling
up fish by the dozen with a pin-hook
and some wrapping twine.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus177a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>It would gratify me if the new
treaty would devote one clause to
a definite settlement of the question
of the bearing of snags upon
the miseries of mankind, and
about eight stupendous clauses
to a determination of the fate that is deserved by that boy.
My own humanitarian tendencies incline me to urge that he
should be summarily shot. If a
boy with a pin-hook is to be allowed
thus to destroy the peace
of older American citizens, the
sooner we ask some efficient and
reliable despot to come over
here and break up the government
and trample on us, the
happier we shall be.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus177b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>I commend the subject to your
enlightened consideration, and ask for an earnest appeal to
the next Congress in behalf of suffering fishermen. If we
cannot obtain redress by peaceful means, let us have it by
force. I am ready to overturn the government, massacre
the people, burn the cities and carry desolation, devastation
and death into every home in the land, rather than to permit
<a class="pagenum" id="page_176">[Pg 176]</a>
these outrages against justice longer to continue and these
unhappy men to endure further persecution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are indications that the course of Bob Parker's
true love will not run entirely smooth. The officers stationed
at Fort Delaware, below here, come up to the village
constantly upon social errands, and they are exceedingly
popular with the young ladies. Lieutenant Smiley is, I
think, the favorite; and as he has become a somewhat frequent
visitor at Magruder's, Bob's jealousy has been aroused.
He hates Smiley with a certain deadly hatred. Mr. Parker
is not naturally warlike in his tendencies, but I believe he
would willingly engage in hostilities with the lieutenant with
an utterly reckless disregard of the consequences.</p>

<p>Smiley comes to see us sometimes; and Bob, I fear, regards
even this family with gloom and suspicion because we
receive the lieutenant courteously. But he says very little
upon the subject; for when he begins to abuse Smiley, I
always ask him why he does not propose to Miss Magruder
at once and thus relieve himself from his agony of apprehension.
Then he beats a retreat. He would rather face a
regiment of Smileys armed with Dahlgren guns than to discuss
the subject of his cowardice respecting the beautiful Magruder.</p>

<p>We like the lieutenant well enough, and we should like
him better but for his propensity for telling incredible stories.
He was in the naval service for eight or ten years; and when
he undertakes to give accounts of his adventures, he is very
apt to introduce anecdotes of which Munchausen would have
been ashamed. It is one of Smiley's favorite theories that
he sojourned for a considerable period among the Fiji
Islands, and many of his narratives relate his experiences
in that region. There was a missionary meeting at the
church a night or two ago, and the lieutenant, having been
<a class="pagenum" id="page_177">[Pg 177]</a>
defeated by Bob in his attempt to escort Miss Magruder to
her home, came to our house; and very naturally he began
the conversation with a story of missionary
enterprise with which he assumed to have become
familiar during his visit to the South Seas.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus179a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Mr. Adeler," he said, "I was very much
interested in the proceedings at that meeting
to-night, but it seems to me that there is one
defect in the system of preparing men for the
work of propagating the gospel among the
heathen."</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus179b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Why they ought to teach the science
of mesmerism in the divinity schools."</p>

<p>"I don't exactly understand the purpose of the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you never heard of
the Rev. Mr. Blodgett, missionary
to the Fiji Islands? Well, he
saved his life once merely by practicing mesmerism. He
has told me the story often."</p>

<p>"I should like to hear it."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus179c.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus180a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"It seems that Blodgett in his sinful youth had been
a traveling professor of mesmerism; but he had abandoned
the business to go into the ministry and to preach
<a class="pagenum" id="page_178">[Pg 178]</a>
to the heathen in Fiji. Well, his church out there got up
a Sunday-school picnic, it appears; and when the people
all arrived upon the ground, they learned that the provisions
had been forgotten. A meeting of the vestry was
called, and after a brief consultation
it was decided that the only thing which could
be done to meet the emergency was to barbecue the
minister. The inducement to this course was all the
stronger because his salary
was six months in arrears, and the church was entirely out
of funds. So they built a huge fire; and seizing Blodgett,
they began to strip him and to stick him with forks.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus180b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_179">[Pg 179]</a></p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus181a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"In order to save himself, he immediately mesmerized each
member of the vestry; and when they were all fixed, he
called up the Sunday-school scholars, class by class, and
put them comfortably to sleep. Having them all completely
under his influence, he gave an entire class to each
one of the vestrymen, and assured them that the innocent
children were the most luscious kind of missionary. Thereupon
the hypnotized vestry immediately ate up the somnambulistic
Sunday-school and picked the bones clean. Blodgett was
a very conscientious man in the performance of his sacerdotal
functions, so he read the funeral
service over each class as it disappeared."</p>

<p>"Rather an excessive meal, I should say."</p>

<p>"Yes, but they are large eaters, the Fijians. You might
say that their appetites are, in a certain sense, robust."</p>

<p>"I should imagine that such was the case. But proceed."</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus181b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Well, when the little ones were gone, Blodgett whispered
to the magnetized wardens that their fellow-vestrymen were also
succulent propagators of Christianity; whereupon the unconscious
wardens fell upon their colleagues, and in a few moments
nearly the whole vestry was in the process of assimilation. There
remained now but the two wardens, and Blodgett, having prevailed
upon the younger and more vigorous of the two to eat
the other, then seized the slumbering body of his converted
<a class="pagenum" id="page_180">[Pg 180]</a>
but erring brother and stood it on its head in the fire. The
Rev. Mr. Blodgett went away alone from
that picnic, and he went with a heavy
heart. When he got home, they asked
where the rest of the folks were, and he
said they were enjoying themselves up there
in the woods in their own quiet, innocent way,
but that he had to come away in order to
visit a sick friend who stood in need of his
ministrations. And then he packed his
trunk and borrowed a canoe and paddled
away to our ship, determined to seek some sunnier
clime, where the heathen rage less furiously, and where
the popular appetite for warm clergyman is not so intensely
vivid."</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus182a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"That is a very remarkable narrative, lieutenant&mdash;very
remarkable indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes. But poor Mott was not so lucky."</p>

<p>"Who was Mott?"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus182b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Why the Rev. Peter Mott&mdash;he was a missionary engaged
upon one of the other islands. He knew nothing of mesmerism;
and when his choir attacked him upon the way
<a class="pagenum" id="page_181">[Pg 181]</a>
home from church one day, he was unable to defend himself,
and they ate him."</p>

<p>"How painful!"</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus183a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"I had to carry the mournful
news to Mrs. Mott, who
lived in San Francisco. When
we reached that port, I called
upon her and performed the
unpleasant duty. The manner
in which she received the intelligence
was, I conceive, in
every way extraordinary. She
cried, of course, and I offered her what consolation I could
under the circumstances. I alluded to the fact that all men
must die at any rate, and dear Mott, let us hope, had gone
to a better world than this one of sorrow and trouble and
so forth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus183b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Mrs. Mott in reply said, with a voice broken with sobs:
<a class="pagenum" id="page_182">[Pg 182]</a>
'It isn't that&mdash;oh, it isn't that. I know he is better off; I'm
sure he is happier; but you know what a very particular
man he was, and oh, Mr. Smiley, I fear that those brutal
savages boiled him with cabbage.' There was no use trying
to assuage her grief under such circumstances, so I shook
hands with her and left. But it was an odd idea.  Mott
with cabbage! I thought as I came away that he would
have tasted better with the merest flavor of onion."</p>

<p>When Lieutenant Smiley bade us good-night, I said,</p>

<p>"Mrs. Adeler, what do you think of that young man?"</p>

<p>"I think," she said, "that he tells the most dreadful falsehoods
I ever listened to. It will be a burning shame if he
succeeds in cutting out Robert with Miss Magruder."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Adeler, he shall not do that. Bob shall have Miss
Magruder at all hazards. If he does not propose to her
shortly, I shall go down and broach the subject to her myself.
We must defeat Smiley even if we have to violate all
the rules of propriety to achieve that result."</p>

<p>We have had a great deal of trouble recently with our kitchen boiler, which is
built into the wall over the range. It sprang a leak a
few weeks ago, and the assistance of a plumber had
to be invoked for the purpose of repairing it. I sent
for the plumber, and after examining the boiler, he instructed
the servant to let the fire go out that night,
so that he could begin operations early the next morning.
His order was obeyed, but in the morning the plumber
failed to appear. We had a cold and very uncomfortable
breakfast, and on my way to the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t I overtook the
plumber going in the same direction. He said he was sorry
to disappoint me, but he was called suddenly out of town on
imperative business, and he would have to ask me to wait
until the next morning, when he would be promptly on hand
with his men. So we had no fire in the range upon that
<a class="pagenum" id="page_184">[Pg 184]</a>
day, and the family breakfasted again upon cool viands
without being cheered with a view of the plumber. Upon
calling at the plumber's shop to ascertain why he had not
fulfilled his promise, I was informed by the clerk that he
had returned, but that he was compelled to
go over to Wilmington. The man seemed
so thoroughly in earnest in his assertion that
the plumber positively would attend to my
boiler upon the following morning that we
permitted the range to remain untouched, and
for the third time we broke our fast with a
frigid repast. But the plumber and his assistants
did not come.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>As it seemed to be wholly impossible to depend upon
these faithless artisans, our cook was instructed to bring
the range into service again without waiting longer for repairs,
and to give the family a properly prepared meal in the morning. While we were
<a class="pagenum" id="page_185">[Pg 185]</a>
at breakfast there was a knock at the gate, and presently we
perceived the plumber and his men coming up the yard with
a general assortment of tools and materials. The range at
the moment of his entrance to the kitchen was red hot;
and when he realized the fact, he flung his tools on
the floor and expressed his indignation in the most violent
and improper language, while his attendant fiends
sat around in the chairs and growled in sympathy with
their chief. When I appeared upon the scene, the
plumber addressed me with the air of a man who had
suffered a great and irreparable wrong at my hands,
and he really displayed so much feeling that for a few moments
I had an indistinct consciousness that I had somehow
been guilty of an act of gross injustice to an unfortunate and
persecuted fellow-being. Before I could recover myself sufficiently
to present my side of the case with the force properly
belonging to it, the plumbers marched into the yard, where
they tossed a quantity of machinery and tools and lead pipe
under the shed, and then left.</p>

</div>

<p>We had no fire in the range
the next morning, but the plumbers did not come until four
o'clock in the afternoon, and then they merely dumped a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_186">[Pg 186]</a>
cart load of lime-boxes and hoes upon the asparagus bed and
went home. An interval of four days elapsed before we
heard of them again; and meanwhile the cook twice nearly
killed herself by stumbling over the tools while going out
into the shed in the dark. One morning, however, the gang
arrived before I had risen; and when I came down to breakfast,
I found that they had made a mortar bed on our best
grass plot, and had closed up the principal garden walk with
a couple of wagon loads of sand. I endured this patiently
because it seemed to promise speedy performance of the
work. The plumbers, however, went away at about nine
o'clock, and the only reason we had for supposing they had
not forgotten us was that a man with a cart called in the
afternoon and shot a quantity of bricks down
upon the pavement in such a position that nobody
could go in or out of the front gate. Two
days afterward the plumbers came and began
to make a genuine effort to reach the boiler. It
was buried in the wall in such a manner that it was wholly
inaccessible by any other method than by the removal of the
bricks from the outside. The man who erected the house
evidently was a party with the plumber to a conspiracy to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_187">[Pg 187]</a>
give the latter individual something to do. They labored
right valiantly at the wall, and by supper-time they had removed
at least twelve square feet of it, making a hole large
enough to have admitted a locomotive. Then they took
out the old boiler and went away, leaving a most discouraging
mass of rubbish lying about the yard.</p>

<p>That was the last we saw of them for more than a week.
Whenever I went after the plumber for the purpose of persuading
him to hasten the work, I learned that he had been
summoned to Philadelphia as a witness in a court case, or
that he had gone to his aunt's funeral, or that he was taking
a holiday because it was his wife's birthday, or that he had
a sore eye. I have never been able to understand why the
house was not robbed. An entire brigade of burglars might
have entered the cottage and frolicked among its treasures
without any difficulty. I did propose at first that Bob and
I should procure revolvers and take watch and watch every
<a class="pagenum" id="page_188">[Pg 188]</a>
night until the breach in the wall should be repaired; but
Mr. Parker did not regard the plan with enthusiasm, and it
was abandoned. We had to
content ourselves with fastening
the inner door of the kitchen as
securely as possible, and we were
not molested. But we were
nervous. Mrs. Adeler, I think,
assured me positively at least
twice every night
that she heard robbers on the stairs, and entreated me not to
go out after them; and I never did.</p>

<div class="figright w10">

</div>

<p>Finally the men came and began to fill the hole with new
bricks. That evening the plumber walked into my parlor
with mud and mortar on his boots, and informed me that
by an unfortunate mistake the hole left for the boiler by the
bricklayers was far too small, and he could not insert the
boiler without taking the wall down again.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nippers," I said, "don't you think it would be a good
idea for me to engage you permanently to labor upon that
boiler? From the manner in which this business has been
conducted, I infer that I can
finally be rid of annoyance about such matters by employing
a perennial plumber to live for ever in my back yard, and
to spend the unending cycles of eternity banging boilers and
demolishing walls."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_189">[Pg 189]</a></p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus190c.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Nippers said, with apparent seriousness, that he thought
it would be a first-rate thing.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nippers, I am going to ask a favor of you. I do not
insist upon compliance with my request. I know that I am
at your mercy. Nippers, you have me, and I submit patiently
to my fate. But my family is suffering from cold, we are exposed
to the ravages of thieves, we are deprived of the means
of cooking our food properly, and we are made generally uncomfortable
by the condition of our kitchen. I ask you,
therefore, as a personal favor to a man who wishes you prosperity
here and felicity hereafter, and who means to settle
your bill promptly, to fix that boiler at once."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus191.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Nippers thereupon said that he always liked me, and
he swore a solemn oath that he would complete the job next
day without fail. That was on Tuesday. Neither Nippers
nor his men came again until Saturday, and then they
put the boiler in its place and went away, leaving four or five
cart loads of ruins in the yard. On Sunday the boiler began
to leak as badly as ever, and I feel sure Nippers must have
set the old one in again, although when he called early Monday
morning with a bill for $237-84/100, which he wanted at
once because he had a note to meet, he declared upon his
<a class="pagenum" id="page_190">[Pg 190]</a>
honor that the boiler was a new one, and that it would not
leak under a pressure of one thousand pounds to the square
inch.</p>

<p>I am going to buy a cooking stove, and defy Nippers and
the entire plumbing fraternity.</p>

<p>Cooley's boy has been in trouble again. Yesterday morning
Mrs. Adeler heard loud screaming in Cooley's yard, and
in a few moments a servant came to say that
Mrs. Cooley wished to see Mrs. Adeler at once.
Mrs. A. hurried over there, supposing that something
terrible had happened. She found Mrs.
Cooley shaking her boy and crying, while the
lad stood, the picture of misery and fright, his eyes protruding
from his head and his
hands holding his stomach.
Mrs. Cooley explained in a
voice broken with sobs
that Henry had been playing
with a small "mouth
organ," and had accidentally
swallowed it. The case
was somewhat peculiar; and
as Mrs. Adeler was not familiar
with the professional
methods which are adopted
in such emergencies, she recommended
simply a liberal
use of mustard and warm water. The application was
ultimately successful, and the missing musical instrument
was surrendered by the boy. The incident is neither interesting
nor remarkable, and I certainly should not have mentioned
it but for the fact that it had a result which is perhaps
worth chronicling here.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_191">[Pg 191]</a></p>

<p>Last evening Bob came into the sitting-room and behaved
in a manner which led me to believe that he had something
on his mind. I asked him if anything was the matter. He
said,</p>

<p>"Well, no; not exactly. The fact is I've been thinking
about that accident to Cooley's boy, and it kind of suggested
something to me."</p>

<p>"What was the nature of the suggestion?"</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus193a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"I've jotted it down on paper. I've half a
notion to send it to the <i>Argus</i> if you think it's
good enough, and that's what I want to find
out. I want to hear your opinion of the story.
I don't do much of this sort of thing, and I'm
kind of shy about it. Shall I read it?"</p>

<p>"Of course; let us hear it."</p>

<p>"I'm going to call it 'The Fate of Young
Chubb.' I expect it'll make old Cooley mad as
fury when he sees it. It is founded upon the
catastrophe of which his boy was the victim."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3><span class="smcap">The Fate of Young Chubb.</span></h3>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus193b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>When Mr. Chubb, the elder, returned from Europe, he
brought with him from Geneva a miniature musical box, long and
very narrow, and altogether of hardly greater dimensions, say, than a
large pocket-knife. The instrument played four cheerful little tunes for
the benefit of the Chubb family, and they enjoyed it. Young Henry
Chubb enjoyed it to such an extent that, one day, just after the
machine had been wound up ready for action, he got to sucking the end
<a class="pagenum" id="page_192">[Pg 192]</a>
of it, and in a moment of inadvertence it slipped, and he
swallowed it. The only immediate consequence of the accident
was that a harmonic stomach-ache was organized
upon the interior of Henry Chubb, and he experienced a
restlessness which he well knew would defy peppermint and
paregoric.</p>

<p>Henry Chubb kept his secret in his own soul, and in his
stomach also, determined to hide his misery from his father,
and to spare the rod to the spoiled child&mdash;spoiled, at any
rate, as far as his digestive apparatus was concerned.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus194.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>But that evening, at the supper-table, Henry had eaten
but one mouthful of bread when strains of wild, mysterious
music were suddenly wafted from under the table. The
family immediately made an effort to discover whence the
sounds came, although Henry Chubb sat there filled with
agony and remorse and bread and tunes, and desperately
asserted his belief that the music came from the cellar, where
<a class="pagenum" id="page_193">[Pg 193]</a>
the servant-girl was concealed with a harp. He well knew
that Mary Ann was unfamiliar with the harp. But he was
frantic with anxiety to hide his guilt. Thus it is that one
crime leads to another.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus195a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>But he could not disguise the truth for ever, and that very
night, while the family was at prayers, Henry all at once
began to hiccough, and the
music box started off without
warning with "Way
down upon the Suwanee
River," with variations.
Whereupon the paternal
Chubb arose from his knees
and grasped Henry kindly
but firmly by his hair and
shook him up and inquired
what he meant by such conduct.
And Henry asserted
that he was practicing something
for a Sunday-school celebration, which old Chubb intimated
was a singularly thin explanation.
Then they tried to get up
that music box, and every time they
would seize Henry by the legs and
shake him over the sofa cushion, or
would pour some fresh variety of
emetic down his throat, the instrument
within would give a fresh spurt,
and joyously grind out "Listen to the
Mocking Bird" or "Thou'lt Never
Cease to Love."</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus195b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>At last they were compelled to permit that musical box to remain within
the sepulchral recesses of young Chubb. To say that the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_194">[Pg 194]</a>
unfortunate victim of the disaster was made miserable by his
condition would be to express in the feeblest manner the state
of his mind. The more music there was in his stomach, the
wilder and more completely chaotic became the discord in
his soul. As likely as not it would occur that while he lay
asleep in the middle of the night the works would begin to
revolve, and would play "Home, Sweet Home" for two or
three hours, unless the peg happened to slip, when the cylinder
would switch back again to "Way down upon the Suwanee
River," and would rattle out that tune with variations and
fragments of the scales until Henry's brother would kick
him out of bed in wild despair,
and sit on him in a vain effort to
subdue the serenade, which, however,
invariably proceeded with
fresh vigor when subjected to unusual pressure.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus196a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>And when Henry Chubb went
to church, it frequently occurred
that, in the very midst of the
most solemn portion of the sermon, he would feel a gentle
disturbance under the lower button of his jacket; and presently,
when everything was hushed, the undigested engine
would give a preliminary buzz and then reel off "Listen
to the Mocking Bird" and "Thou'lt Never Cease to
Love," and scales and exercises, until the clergyman
would stop and
glare at Henry over his spectacles and whisper to one of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_195">[Pg 195]</a>
deacons. Then the sexton would suddenly tack up the aisle
and clutch the unhappy Mr. Chubb by the collar and scud
down the aisle again to the accompaniment of "Home, Sweet
Home," and then incarcerate Henry in the upper portion of
the steeple until after church.</p>

<div class="figright w50">
<img src="images/illus196b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>
<p>But the end came at last, and the miserable boy found
peace. One day while he was sitting in school endeavoring
to learn his multiplication table to the tune of "Thou'lt
Never Cease to Love," his gastric juice triumphed. Something
or other in the music box gave way all at once, the
springs were unrolled with alarming force, and Henry Chubb,
as he felt the fragments of the instrument hurled right and
left among his vitals, tumbled over on the floor and expired.</p>

<p>At the <i>post mortem</i> examination they found several pieces
of "Home, Sweet Home" in his liver, while one of his lungs
was severely torn by a fragment of "Way down upon the
Suwanee River." Small particles of "Listen to the Mocking
Bird" were removed from his heart and breast-bone,
and three brass pegs of "Thou'lt Never Cease to Love"
were found firmly driven into his fifth rib.</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus197.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>They had no music at the funeral. They
sifted the machinery out of him and buried
him quietly in the cemetery. Whenever the
Chubbs buy musical boxes now, they get them
as large as a piano and chain them to the wall.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While Bob was engaged in reading the account of the
melodious misery of the unhappy Chubb, Lieutenant Smiley
came in, and the result was that both became uneasy. Bob
disliked to subject himself to the criticism of a man whom
he regarded as an enemy, and the lieutenant was so jealous
of Bob's success that he began instantly to try to think of
something that would enable him at least to maintain his
reputation as a teller of stories.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_196">[Pg 196]</a></p>

<p>"That is very good indeed, Bob," I said. "Bangs will
be only too glad to publish it. It is very creditable. Put
your name to it, however, if it goes into the <i>Argus</i>, or the
colonel will persuade the community that he is the author
of it."</p>

<p>"He will have to get a new brain-pan set in before he can
write anything as good," said Bob.</p>

<p>"It is a very amusing story," remarked Mrs. Adeler. "I
had no idea that you ever attempted such things. It is quite
good, is it not, lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very good indeed," said Smiley. "V-e-r-y good.
Quite an achievement, in fact. Ha! ha! do you know that
name 'Chubb' reminds me of a very comical incident."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"Ha! yes! Old General Chubb was the actor in it.
Perhaps you knew him, Parker?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," growled Bob.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus198.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Well, he was a very eccentric old man. Deuced queer,
you know, and the most absent-minded
person that ever lived. He had a
wooden leg late in his life, and I've
often known him to put that leg on
backward with the toes pointing behind
him, and then he would come
jolting down the street in the most
extraordinary manner, with his good
knee bending north and his timber
knee doubling up southwardly; and
when I would meet him, he would
stop and growl because the authorities
kept the pavements in such bad repair
that a man could hardly walk."</p>

<p>"I don't see anything very funny about that," said Bob,
impolitely and savagely.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_197">[Pg 197]</a></p>

<div class="figright w50">
<img src="images/illus199a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Well, one day a few months ago," continued Smiley,
without noticing Mr. Parker's ill-nature, "he sauntered
into the studio of the celebrated marine painter
Hamilton, in Philadelphia. The artist was out at the
moment, but standing upon the floor was a large and
very superb picture of the sea-beach, with the surf rolling
in upon it. The general stood looking at it for
a while, until his mind wandered off from the present,
and under the influence of the picture he was gradually
impressed with a vague notion that he was at the seashore.
So, still gazing at the painting, he slowly removed his clothes,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_198">[Pg 198]</a>
and finally stood in a revery without a stitch upon him.
Then he clasped his nose with his fingers, bent his neck forward
and plunged head foremost into the surf. The people
on the floor below thought there was an earthquake. The
artist came rushing in, and found General Chubb with his
head against the washboard, one leg hanging from the ragged
surf and the toes of his left foot struggling among the
ruins of the lighthouse. Hamilton has that torn picture yet.
He says that Chubb's dive is the highest tribute ever paid to
his genius."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus199b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>As the lieutenant finished the narrative, Bob rose and left
the room with the suggestion, muttered as he passed me, that
the story was tough.</p>

<p>"Mr. Parker don't seem well," remarked the lieutenant
when Bob had gone.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he is perfectly well. I imagine that he does not
regard you with precisely the same amount of enthusiastic
admiration that he might perhaps feel if you were not treading
on his toes a little."</p>

<p>"Oh," laughed the lieutenant, "you refer, of course, to
our relations with the Magruders? I don't like to talk much
about that matter, of course; it is delicate, and you may
think I am meddling with a business in which I have no
concern. But perhaps I may as well tell you frankly that
Parker has no earthly chance there&mdash;not the least in the
world. The young lady won't smile on him. I am as certain
of that as I am of death."</p>

<p>"You are positive of that, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, you can rely upon my word. Parker might as
well give it up. By the way, I wonder if he has gone down
there now?"</p>

<p>"Very likely."</p>

<p>"Well, I must say good-night, then; I promised to call
there at half-past eight, and it is time to be off."</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_199">[Pg 199]</a></p>

<p>So Lieutenant Smiley bade us adieu. Mrs. Adeler immediately
asked:</p>

<p>"Do you believe what that man says?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, my dear. I have as much faith as a
dozen ordinary men, but it would require a grand army to
believe him. He is foolish enough to hope to frighten Bob
away. But Bob shall settle the matter to-morrow. If he
doesn't, we will disown him. The end of the campaign has
come. Now for victory or defeat!"</p>

<p>This is St. Pillory's Day. It is the day upon which humane
and liberal Delawarians hang their heads for shame at the
insult offered to civilization by the law of their State. That
law this morning placed half a dozen miserable creatures in
the stocks, and then flogged them upon their naked flesh
with a cat-o'-nine-tails. It was no slight thing to stand
there wearing that wooden collar in this bitter November
weather, with the north-east wind blowing in fierce gusts from
the broad expanse of the river; and one poor wretch who
endured that suffering was so benumbed with cold that he
could hardly climb down the ladder to the ground. And
when he had descended, they lashed his back until it was
covered with purple stripes. He had stolen some provisions,
and he looked as if he needed them, for he seemed hungry
and forlorn and utterly desperate with misery. It would
<a class="pagenum" id="page_201">[Pg 201]</a>
have been a kindlier act of Christian charity if society, instead
of mutilating his body, had fed it and clothed it properly,
and placed him in some reformatory institution where
his soul could have been taken care of. But that is not the
method that prevails here.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus203a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>The gates of the prison yard were wide open when the punishment
was inflicted upon these offenders, and among the spectators
were at least two or three score children gathered to look upon the
barbarous spectacle. Nothing could induce me to permit mine
to witness it. The influence of such a scene is wholly brutalizing.
The child that has seen that sacrifice
has lost some of the sweetness and tenderness of its
better nature.</p>

<div class="figright w50">
<img src="images/illus203b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>The whipping-post and pillory is a sturdy bit of
timber a foot square. Eight or nine feet from the ground
it pierces a small platform, and five feet above this there
is a cross-piece which contains in each of its two arms
a hole for the neck and two holes for the wrists of the
man who is to be pilloried. The upper half of the arm
lifts to admit the victim, and then closes upon him, sometimes
very tightly. It is fastened down with a wedge-shaped
key, shot into the centre-post. Beneath the platform hangs
<a class="pagenum" id="page_202">[Pg 202]</a>
a pair of handcuffs in which the wrists of those who are to
be flogged are placed. The whole machine looks like a
gigantic cross. It is black with age, covered with patches
of green mold and moss, and shrunken and split until the
grain of the wood protrudes in ridges.</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illus204.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>There was a time in the past when it stood, an instrument
of cruel torture, upon the public street. It was planted in
the green just at the end of the old market house, and there
the criminals were lashed by the sheriff. Any of the old
men who have spent their lives in this place can tell
how, when they were boys, it was the custom for the
urchins and the loafers of the town to pelt any poor
rogue who was pilloried with whatever missiles happened to
be at hand; and often the creatures thus abused were taken
down from the stocks and tied up to the post, there to have
their flesh lacerated with the leather thongs. They used to
flog women, too. They flogged women in the open street,
with their garments torn away from their bodies above the
waist, and the gaping crowd gathered about and witnessed
without shame that dreadful spectacle.</p>

<p>But that was more than half a century ago. Who shall
say that we do not advance in civilization? Who can assert
that these people have not acquired a higher sense of decency,
when public opinion has compelled the removal of this abominable
relic of barbarism to the jail-yard, and the performance
of the penalty in another place than before the doors
of the temple where a God of mercy is worshiped? I hope
that the day is not far distant when the whipping-post and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_203">[Pg 203]</a>
the infernal system that sustains it will go down together,
and when the people of this State will learn that their first
duty to a criminal is to strive to make him a better man.</p>

<p>They say here, in apologizing for the institution, that the
punishment is not severe, because the sheriff never makes
savage use of the lash. But it is a terrible infliction, no
matter how lightly the blows are struck, for it is imposed in
the presence of a multitude, and the sufferer feels that he is
for ever to be known among men as a thief. The thongs do
not always fall gently; the force of the lash depends upon
the will of the sheriff, who may kill a man with the number
of blows which in another case give no pain. I say that
any law which places such discretionary power in the hands
of an executive officer who may be bribed or frightened, or
who may have some personal injury to avenge, defeats the
true end of justice. The court should fix the penalty absolutely.
They say here, also, that no man is ever flogged a
second time. That is untrue. The same men do return
again and again. Some do not; but where do they go?
Why, to other communities, where they perpetrate other
crimes and become a burden upon other people. We have
no right to breed criminals and then to drive them into cities
and towns that have already enough of their own. We are
under a sacred obligation to place them in prisons supported
by the money of the State, and there to attempt to teach
them arts by which they may earn their bread if they will.
In such a place a convict can be reached by those philanthropists
who realize what society owes to its criminal classes.
But as he is treated now, it is impossible that he should ever
lift himself or be lifted to a purer and better life.</p>

<p>Fallen angels in Delaware never rise again. Law clips
their wings and stamps upon them with its heel, and society
shakes off the dust of its feet upon them and curses them in
their degradation. The gates of mercy are shut upon them
<a class="pagenum" id="page_204">[Pg 204]</a>
hopelessly and for ever, and they walk abroad with the story
of their shame blazoned upon them, as the women who wore
the Scarlet Letter in the old Puritan times in New England,
that all the world may read it. They know that their punishment
has been fierce and terrible and out of all proportion
to their offence, and they curse their oppressors and
hate them with a bitter, unrelenting hatred. They know
they will not be allowed to reform, and that the law which
should have led them to a better future has cut them off
from fellowship with their race, robbed them of their humanity
and made pariahs and outcasts of them. They are turned
to stone, and they come out of their prisons confirmed, hopeless
criminals.</p>

<p>A certain judge who administered Delaware justice here
once upon a time (we will say it was a thousand years ago)
was a very peculiar man in certain of his methods. I do not
know whether he was merely fond of listening to the music
of his own voice, as too many less reverend and awful men
are, or whether he really loved to torture the prisoners
in the dock, when he sentenced them, by keeping
them in suspense respecting his intentions, and by exciting
hopes which he finally crushed. But he had a way
of assuming a mild and benevolent aspect as he addressed
a convicted man which was very reassuring
to the unhappy wight, and then he usually proceeded
to deliver a few remarks
which were so ingeniously arranged, which expressed such
<a class="pagenum" id="page_205">[Pg 205]</a>
tender and affectionate sympathy, which were so highly
charged with benevolence, so expressive, as it were, of a
passionate yearning for the welfare of the victim, that the
latter at last would be convinced that the judge was about
to give him an exceedingly light sentence. Just as he had
gotten himself into a frame of mind suitable to the unexpected
brightness of his prospects, the judge's custom was to
bring his observations suddenly to an end, and to hurl at
the head of the convict, still with that philanthropic expression
upon his countenance, the most frightful penalty permitted
by the law.</p>

</div>

<p>On a certain day, while a certain historian was in court,
he was engaged in exercising a youth named Busby in this
fashion. Busby, it appears, was accused of stealing seventy-five
cents' worth of old iron from somebody, and the jury had
found him guilty.</p>

<p>Busby was ordered to stand up, and the judge, permitting a
peculiarly bland smile to play upon his features, gazed tenderly
at the prisoner, while he placed a small pinch of tobacco in his
mouth; and then, drawing a long breath, he began:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus207b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"George Washington Busby, you have been found guilty
by a jury of your fellow-countrymen of an offence against
society and against the peace and dignity of the commonwealth
<a class="pagenum" id="page_206">[Pg 206]</a>
of Delaware, and I have now to impose upon you the
penalties provided by the law. I am very, very sorry to see
you here, George, and it grieves my heart to be compelled
to fulfill the obligation devolving upon me as a judicial officer.
Pause, I entreat you, at this the very outset of your career,
and reflect upon what you are casting from you. You are
a young man; you are, as it were, in the very morning of
your life; a bright and happy home is yours, and around
you are the kind parents and friends who have made you
the child of their prayers, who have guided your footsteps
from infancy, who have loved and cherished you and made
for you mighty sacrifices.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus208a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"You have a mother"&mdash;and here the judge's voice faltered
and he wiped away a tear&mdash;"a mother at whose knee
you were taught to lisp your earliest devotions, and who has watched over
you and ministered to you with that tender and fervent love that only a
mother can feel. You have a father who looked upon you with a heart
swelling with pride, and who gave to you the heritage of his honest
name. Up to the time when, yielding
to the insidious wiles of the tempter, you committed this
crime, your character had been irreproachable, and it seemed
as if the brightest promises of your childhood were to have
rich and beneficent fulfillment. For you the vista of the
future appeared serene and beautiful; a pure
and noble manhood seemed to await you, and
all the blessings which may be gained by
an unspotted reputation, by persistent energy
and by earnest devotion to the right were to be yours."</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus208b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Here Busby began to feel considerably better. He was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_207">[Pg 207]</a>
assured that such a kind old man as that could not treat
him with severity, and he informed the tipstaff in a whisper
that he calculated now on about sixty days' imprisonment
at the furthest.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus209a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>The judge shifted the quid in his cheek, blew his nose, and
resumed:</p>

<p>"How difficult it is, then, for
me to determine the precise
measure of your punishment!
Knowing that the quality of
mercy is not strained, and that
as we forgive so shall we be
forgiven, how painful it is for
me to draw the line between
undue leniency and the demands
of outraged law! Considering, I say, all these things, that
are so much in your favor&mdash;your youth, your happy home,
where the holiest influences are shed upon your path, where
parental love covers you with its most gracious benediction,
where your devoted mother lies stricken with anguish at the
sin of her idolized son, where your aged father has his gray
hairs brought down in sorrow to the grave, where you have
been nurtured and admonished and taught to do right&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus209b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Certainly he can't intend to give me more than one month," said Busby
to the tipstaff.</p>

<p>"Considering that this is your first
offence; that your conduct hitherto
has been that of an honest young
man, and that the lesson you have
learned from this bitter and terrible
experience will sink deeply into your
<a class="pagenum" id="page_208">[Pg 208]</a>
heart; that you have opening out to you in the possible
future a life of usefulness and honor, with a prospect of redeeming
this single error and winning for yourself a respected
name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He can't decently give me more than twenty days after
that," suggested Busby.</p>

<p>The judge, after wiping the moisture from his eyes and
borrowing a morsel of tobacco from the prosecuting attorney,
continued:</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus210.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"In view of all these extenuating circumstances, in view
of the fact, fully recognized by this court, that justice is not
revengeful, but exercises its highest prerogative in leading
the fallen to reformation and moral improvement&mdash;in view,
I say, of the fact that you are in the very spring-time of
your existence, with the vista of the future opening out with
alluring brightness before you and giving promise of higher
and better things&mdash;in view of those sorrowing parents the
child of whose prayers you are; of that mother who guided
your infant steps and cared for you
with the yearning tenderness of maternal
love, of that venerable father
who looks upon you as the staff of his
old age; considering, too, that this is
your first misstep from the path of
duty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two weeks as sure as death!" exclaimed Mr. Busby, joyfully, to the
officer beside him.</p>

<p>"The path of duty," continued the judge, "and that up to the moment
of the commission of the deed you had
been above suspicion and above reproach,&mdash;in view of all
this," remarked the judge, "I have thought it my duty,
minister of the law though I am, and bound though I
<a class="pagenum" id="page_209">[Pg 209]</a>
am by my oath to vindicate the insulted majesty of that
law&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus211a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"If he gives me more than one week, I will never trust
signs again," murmured Busby.</p>

<p>"I say that although I am bound to administer justice with an impartial
hand, I feel it to be incumbent upon me in this particular
instance, in consequence of these extenuating circumstances, to
mete it out so that, while the law will be vindicated, you may be
taught that it is not cruel or unkind, but rather is capable of giving
the first generous impulse to reformation."</p>

<p>"He certainly means to let me off altogether," exclaimed
Busby.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus211b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"In view, then, of these mitigating circumstances of your
youth, your previous good character, your happy prospects,
your afflicted parents and your own sincere repentance, the
sentence of the court is: That you, George Washington Busby,
the prisoner at the bar, do pay seventy-five cents restitution
money and the costs of this trial, and that on Saturday
next you be whipped with twenty lashes on the bare back,
well laid on; that you be imprisoned
for six months in the county jail, and that you
<a class="pagenum" id="page_210">[Pg 210]</a>
wear a convict's jacket in public for one year after your
release. Sheriff, remove the prisoner from the court."</p>

<p>Then the judge beamed a mournful but sympathetic smile
upon Busby, secured the loan of another atom of tobacco,
spat on the floor and called up the next case.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Adeler, you laugh and say that I have indulged in
gross exaggeration in reproducing the sentence. Not so.
I tell you that I have known a boy of thirteen to have that
condemnation, couched in almost precisely those words, hurled
at him from the bench of the New Castle court-house because
he stole a bit of iron said to be worth seventy-five cents.
And I was present among the spectators in the jail yard
when the sheriff lashed the lad until he writhed with pain.
It was infamous&mdash;utterly infamous. I cannot, perhaps,
justly accuse the judge who imposed the sentence upon the
boy of indulging in the lecture which has just been quoted.
That, as I have said, may be attributed to a magistrate who
lived ten centuries ago. But the sentence is genuine, and
it was given recently. I do not blame the judge. He acted
under the authority of statutes which were created by other
hands. But the law is savagery itself, and the humane men
of this State should sweep it from existence.</p>

<h2 id="chapter_xiv">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">A Delaware Legend&mdash;A Story of the Old Time&mdash;The
Christmas Play&mdash;A Cruel Accusation&mdash;The Flight in
the Darkness along the River Shore&mdash;The Trial and
the Condemnation&mdash;St. Pillory's Day seventy Years

<div class="figleft w25">

</div>

<p>While the scenes at the whipping-post on flogging-day
are fresh in my mind, I have written down the
story of Mary Engle. It is a Delaware legend, and
the events of which it speaks occurred, I will say, seventy-odd
years ago, when they were in the habit of lashing
women in this very town of New Castle.</p>

<p>It was on Christmas day that a little party had assembled
in the old Newton mansion to participate in the
festivities for which, at this season of the year, it was famous
all the country over. The house stood upon the river bank,
three miles and more from New Castle, and in that day
it was considered the greatest and handsomest building in
the whole neighborhood. A broad lawn swept away from
it down to the water's edge, and in summer-time this was
covered with bright-colored flowers and bounded by green
hedges. Now the grass was bleached with the cold; the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_212">[Pg 212]</a>
hedges were brown and sere, and the huge old trees, stripped
of their foliage, moaned and creaked and shivered in the
wind, rattling their branches together as if seeking sympathy
with each other in their desolation.</p>

<p>Inside the mansion the scene was as cheerful as life and
fun and high spirits could make it.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus214.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Old Major Newton, the lord and master of all the wide
estates, was one of the race of country gentlemen who introduced
to this continent the manners, habits and large hospitality
of the better class of English squires of his day. He
was a mighty fox-hunter, as many a brush hung in his dining-hall
could attest. A believer in the free use of the good
things of life, his sideboard always contained a dozen decanters,
from which the coming, the remaining
and the parting guests were expected to
follow the major's example in drinking
deeply. His table was always profusely
supplied with good fare, and dining with
him was the great duty and pleasure of the day. He was a
gentleman in education, and to some extent in his tastes; but
his manners partook of the coarseness of his time, for he
swore fierce oaths, and his temper was quick, terrible and
violent. His forty negro slaves were treated with indulgent
kindness while they obeyed him implicitly, but any attempt
at insubordination upon their part called down upon their
heads a volley of oaths and that savage punishment which
the major considered necessary to discipline.</p>

<p>To-day the major had been out of spirits, and had not
joined heartily in the hilarity of the company, which, despite
the gloom of the master, made the old house ring with the
merriment and laughter due to the happiness of Christmas
time.</p>

<p>At five o'clock dinner was done; and the ladies having
withdrawn, the cloth was removed, the wine and whisky and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_213">[Pg 213]</a>
apple-toddy, and a half dozen other beverages, were brought
out, and the major, with his male guests, began the serious
work of the repast. The major sat at the head of the table;
Dr. Ricketts, a jolly bachelor of fifty, who neglected medicine
that he might better spend his fortune in a life of ease
and pleasure, presided at the lower end of the board, upon
the flanks of which sat a dozen gentlemen from the neighboring
estates, among them Tom Willitts, from the adjoining
farm, and Dick Newton, the major's only son.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus215.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>The conversation languished somewhat. The major was
as gloomy as he had been earlier in the day. Dick seemed
to sympathize with his father. Tom Willitts was impatient
to have the drinking bout over, that he might go to the parlor,
where his thoughts already wandered, and where his
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, Mary Engle, the fair governess in the major's
family, awaited him. The guests at last began to be
depressed by the want of spirits in their host; and if it had
not been for Doctor Ricketts, there would have been a dull
time indeed. But the doctor was talkative, lively and
wholly indifferent to the taciturnity of his companions. His
weakness was a fondness for theorizing, and he rattled on
from topic to topic, heedless of anything but the portly
<a class="pagenum" id="page_214">[Pg 214]</a>
goblet which he replenished time and again from the
decanter and the punch-bowl.</p>

<p>At last he exclaimed, in the hope of rousing his host
from his apparent despondency, "And now let's have a
song from the major. Give us the 'Tally Ho!' Newton."</p>

<p>"I can't sing it to-day, gentlemen," said the major; "the
fact is I am a good deal out of sorts. I have met with a
misfortune, and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, what's happened?" exclaimed the whole company.</p>

<p>"Why," said the major, with an oath, "I've lost my
famous old diamond brooch&mdash;a jewel, gentlemen, given to
my father by George II.&mdash;a jewel that I valued more than
all the world beside. It was the reward given to my father
for a brave and gallant deed at the battle of Dettingen, and
its rare intrinsic value was trifling beside that which it possessed
as the evidence of my father's valor."</p>

<p>"How did you lose it, major?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"I went to my desk this morning, and found that the lock
had been picked, the inside drawer broken open and the
brooch taken from its box."</p>

<p>"Who could have done it?"</p>

<p>"I can't imagine," replied the major; "I don't think any
of those niggers would have done such a thing. I've searched
them all, but it's of no use, sir&mdash;no use; it's gone. But if I
ever lay hands on the scoundrel, I'll flay him alive&mdash;I will,
indeed, even if it should be Dick there;" and the old man
gulped down a heavy draught of port, as if to drown his
grief.</p>

<p>"My theory about such crimes," said the doctor, "is
that the persons committing them are always more or less
insane."</p>

<p>"Insane!" swore the major, fiercely. "If I catch the
man who did this, I'll fit him for a hospital!"</p>

<p>"We are all a little daft at times&mdash;when we are angry, in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_215">[Pg 215]</a>
love, in extreme want, or excited by intense passion of any
kind," said the doctor. "Extreme ignorance, being neglect
of one's intellectual faculties, is a kind of insanity, and so is
the perversion of the moral perceptions of those who are
educated to a life of crime from their childhood. My theory
is that punishment should be so inflicted as to restore reason,
not merely to wreak vengeance."</p>

<p>"And my theory is that every vagabond who breaks the
laws ought to be flogged and imprisoned, so that he may
know that society will not tolerate crime. Hang your fine-spun
theories about the beggars who prey upon the community!"
said the major, rising and kicking back his chair ill-naturedly.</p>

<p>The doctor had nothing more to say, and the company
withdrew to the parlor.</p>

<p>There, gathered around the great fireplace, sat Mrs. Newton,
her daughters&mdash;both children&mdash;Mary Engle, their tutor,
Mrs. Willitts and the wives of the gentlemen who had come
from the dinner-table.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus217.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>They rose as the men entered the room, and greeted them
cordially. Tom Willitts went quickly to Mary's side, and
while the others engaged in lively conversation he took her
hand gently and, as was their privilege, they walked slowly
up the room and sat by the window alone, Mary's face
brightening as she thanked Tom heartily for the beautiful present
he had sent her the day before.</p>

<p>"Why don't you wear it now, Mary?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to? I will get it and put it on, then, when I
go to my room," said Mary.</p>

<p>Mary Engle was the daughter of a widow in humble circumstances
<a class="pagenum" id="page_216">[Pg 216]</a>
who lived in the village. Talented and well-educated,
she had determined no longer to be a burden upon
her mother, but to support herself. She had chosen to become
a governess in Major Newton's family. Young, beautiful
and of good social position, she was a valuable acquisition
to that household, and was a universal favorite, although
the major could never quite rid himself of the notion that,
as she was a dependant and an employ&eacute;, he was conferring
a favor upon her by permitting such intimate relations to
exist between her and his family. But he treated her
kindly, as all men must a pretty woman. She was a girl
with whom any man might have fallen in love upon first
acquaintance. Dick Newton loved her passionately before
she had been in his father's house a month. But she had
chosen rather to favor Tom Willitts, a constant visitor at
the Newton mansion, and as fine a fellow as ever galloped
across the country with the hounds. Dick had not had time
to propose before the game was up and Tom called the prize
his own. But Dick nursed his passion and smothered his
disappointment, while he swore that he would possess the
girl or involve her and her lover in common ruin with himself.
Tom had been engaged for three months before this
Christmas day. He was to be married in the coming
spring.</p>

<p>There was to be a theatrical exhibition in the Newton
mansion this Christmas evening, in which the young people
were to participate. A temporary stage had been erected at
one end of the long room, and at an early hour seats were
placed in front of the curtain, and the guests took their
places, conversing with much merriment and laughter until
the bell gave the signal for the performance to begin.</p>

<p>It was a little play&mdash;a brief comedy of only tolerable merit,
and it devolved upon Mary Engle to enter first.</p>

<p>She tripped in smiling, and began the recitation with a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_217">[Pg 217]</a>
vivacity and spirit that promised well for the excellence of
her performance throughout. Upon her throat she wore a
diamond brooch which blazed and flashed in the glare of the
foot-lights.</p>

<p>There was an exclamation of surprise on the part of the
gentlemen present, and the sound startled Mary. She
paused and looked around her inquiringly. Just then
Major Newton caught sight of the brooch. With an ugly
word upon his lips, he sprang from his seat and jumped upon
the stage.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that?" he demanded, fiercely, pointing
at the diamonds, his hand trembling violently.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus219.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>There was absolute silence in the room as Mary, pale and
calm, replied:</p>

<p>"Why do you ask, sir?"</p>

<p>"Where did you get that, I say? It was stolen from me.
You are a thief!"</p>

<p>In an instant she tore it from her dress and flung it upon the
floor.</p>

<p>The major leaped toward it and picked it up quickly.</p>

<p>Mary covered her face with her hands, and the crimson
of her cheeks shone through her fingers.</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?" again demanded the major.</p>

<p>"I will not tell you, sir," said she, dragging down her
hands with an effort and clasping them in front of her.</p>

<p>"Then leave this house this instant, and leave it for ever!"
said the major, wild with passion.</p>

<p>Tom Willitts entered just as the last words were uttered.
Mary seemed fainting. He flew to her side as if to defend
her against her enemy. He did not know the cause of her
trouble, but he glared at the major as if he could slay him.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_218">[Pg 218]</a>
But as he tried to place his arm around Mary, she shrank
away from him; and giving him one look of scorn and contempt
and hatred, she ran from the room.</p>

<p>From the room to the great door in the hall, which, with
frantic eagerness, she flung open, and then, without any
covering upon her fair head, hot with shame and disgrace,
and maddened with insult, she fled out into the cold and
dark and desolate winter's night.</p>

<p>Scarcely heeding the direction, she reached the river's
shore; and choosing the hard sand for a pathway, she hurried
along it. The tide swept up in ceaseless ripples at her
feet, the waves breaking upon the icy fringe of the shore,
each with a whisper that seemed to tell of her dishonor.
The wind rustled the sedges upon the banks and filled them
with voices that mocked her. The stars that lighted her
upon her mad journey twinkled through the frosty air with
an intelligence they had never before possessed. The lights,
far out upon the river and in the distant town, danced up
and down in the darkness as if beckoning her to come on to
them and to destruction.</p>

<p>Her brain was in a whirl. At first she felt an impulse to
end her misery in the river. One plunge, and all this
anguish and pain would be buried beneath those restless
waters. Then the hope of vindication flashed upon her
mind, and the awful sin and the cowardice of self-destruction
rose vividly before her. She would seek her home and the
mother from whom she should never have gone out. She
would give up happiness and humanity, and hide herself
from the cold, heartless world for ever. She would have no
more to do with false friends and false lovers, but would shut
herself away from all this deceit and treachery and unkindness,
and nevermore trust any human being but her own
dear mother.</p>

<p>And so, over the sandy beach, through mire and mud,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_219">[Pg 219]</a>
through the high grass and the reeds of the water's edge,
tangled and dead, and full of peril in the darkness, with
her hair disheveled and tossed about by the riotous wind,
but with not a tear upon her white face, she struggled onward
through the night, until, exhausted with her journey,
her wild passion and her misery, she reached her mother's
house, and entering, clasped her arms about her mother's
neck, and with a sob fell fainting at her feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus221.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was an end to merriment at the Newton mansion.
When Mary ran from the room, the company stood for a
moment amazed and bewildered, while the major, raging
with passion, yet half ashamed of his furious conduct, walked
rapidly up and down the stage, attempting to explain the
theft to his guests and to justify his conduct. But Tom
Willitts, shocked at the cruel treatment he had received
from Mary, yet filled with righteous indignation at the
major's violence, interrupted his first utterance.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_220">[Pg 220]</a></p>

<p>"You are a coward and a brute, sir; and old as you are,
I will make you answer for your infamous treatment of that
young girl."</p>

<p>And before the major could reply he dashed out to pursue
Mary and give her his protection. He sought her in vain
upon the highway; and filled with bitterness, and wondering
why she had so scorned him, he trudged on through the
darkness, peering about him vainly for the poor girl for
whom he would have sacrificed his life.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was merely a jest," suggested Mrs. Willitts.
"I think Mary wholly incapable of theft. She never could
have intended seriously to keep the brooch."</p>

<p>"A pretty serious jest," said the major, "to break into my
desk three days ago. It's the kind of humor that puts people
in jail."</p>

<p>"My theory about the matter," said the doctor, "is this:
She either was made the victim of a pretty ugly practical
joke, or else some one stole the jewel from you and gave it
to her to get her into trouble."</p>

<p>"I don't believe anything of the kind," said the major.</p>

<p>"It must be so. If she had stolen it, she certainly would
not have worn it in your presence this evening. It is absurd
to suppose such a thing. Taking this theory&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hang theorizing!" exclaimed the major, seeing the force
of this suggestion, but more angry that he was driven to
admit it to his own mind. "She is a thief, and as sure as I
live she shall either confess, tell how she got the jewel or go
to prison."</p>

<p>"And as sure as I live," said the doctor, grown indignant
and serious, "I will unravel this mystery and clear this innocent
girl of this most infamous and wicked imputation."</p>

<p>"Do it if you can!" said the major, and turned his back
upon him contemptuously.</p>

<p>The doctor left the house, and the company dispersed,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_221">[Pg 221]</a>
eager gossips, all of them, to tell the story far and wide
throughout the community before to-morrow's noon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Mary had revived and told, in broken words, the
story of her misery and disgrace, her mother soothed and
comforted her with the assurance that she should never leave
her again; and while she denounced Major Newton's conduct
bitterly, she said he would find that he had made a mistake
and would clear her of the charge.</p>

<p>"But he will not find it out, mother."</p>

<p>"Why? Where did you get the brooch, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Do not ask me, mother; I cannot, cannot tell you."</p>

<p>"Had you merely picked it up and put it on in jest?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Mary, "it was given to me, I cannot tell
by whom, and I thought it was mine. It was cruel, cruel!"
and her tears came again.</p>

<p>"And who was it that did so vile a thing?" asked her
mother.</p>

<p>"Mother, I cannot tell even you that."</p>

<p>"But, Mary, this is foolish. You must not, for your own
sake, for mine, hide the name of this criminal."</p>

<p>"I will never, never tell. I will die first."</p>

<p>"Was it Tom Willitts?"</p>

<p>"You must not question me, mother," said Mary, firmly.
"If the person who betrayed me is cowardly enough to place
me in such a position, and then to stand coldly by and witness
my shame, I am brave enough and true enough to
bear the burden. I would rather have this misery than
his conscience."</p>

<p>Tom Willitts knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"If it is Tom Willitts, mother," said Mary, rising, "tell
him I will not see him. Tell him never to come to this
house again. Tell him," she said, her eyes glowing with
excitement, and stamping her foot upon the floor, "tell him I
<a class="pagenum" id="page_222">[Pg 222]</a>
hate him&mdash;hate him for a false, mean villain!" and she fell
back upon the chair in a wild passion of tears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Engle met Tom at the door. He was filled with
anxiety and terror, but he rejoiced that Mary was safe.
Mrs. Engle told him that Mary refused to see him. He
was smitten with anguish, and begged for a single word
with her.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about this wicked business, Mr.
Willitts?" asked Mrs. Engle, suspicious, because of Mary's
words, that Tom was the criminal.</p>

<p>"Upon my honor I do not. I heard Major Newton's
language, and saw the brooch upon the floor; and when
Mary fled from me, I pursued her, wondering what it all
meant."</p>

<p>"She evidently suspects you of having been the cause of
the trouble. Prove that you were not. Until then she will
not see you. I beg you, for yourself and her, to tell the
truth about this, if you know it, or at least to persist till you
discover it."</p>

<p>Tom went away distressed and confounded. She suspected
him. No wonder, then, she had spurned him so
rudely. He thought the matter over, and could arrive at
no solution of the difficulty. He had sent her a bracelet
which she had promised to wear, but she had not worn it.
It was impossible that this brooch could have been substituted.
No, his own servant had given it to her, and brought
her thanks in return. Besides, who could be base enough to
play such a dastardly trick upon a pretty young girl? He
could not master the situation; and in his trouble he went
the next morning to Dr. Ricketts.</p>

<p>The doctor was equally puzzled, but he was certain that
there was foul play somewhere. He had pledged himself to
unravel the mystery, and he began the work by visiting
Mary. Alone, he went to her house. He found it in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_223">[Pg 223]</a>
strange commotion. Mrs. Engle was sitting upon the sofa,
crying bitterly; Mary, with pale, sad face, but with an air
of determination, confronted an obsequious man, who, with
many apologies and a manner that proved that he was
ashamed of his business, extended a paper toward her, and
requested her to accompany him.</p>

<p>It was a constable with a warrant for her arrest.</p>

<p>Nearly five weary months were to pass before the cruel
time of the trial. Dr. Ricketts busied himself examining
every one who could possibly have been connected with the
affair of the brooch, but with no result but a deeper mystery.
Tom's servant swore that he had given the bracelet into
Mary's own hand. Two of the house servants at Major
Newton's were present at the time, and they were certain
the package was not broken. Mary's thimble had been
found under the broken desk in which the brooch was kept,
and the housemaid had discovered a chisel secreted behind
some books in the bookcase in her room.</p>

<p>The evidence, slight though it was, pointed to Mary as
the criminal, despite the absurdity of the supposition, in
view of the manner in which she had worn the jewel. Mary
herself preserved an obstinate silence, refusing to tell how
or where or from whom she procured the fatal brooch. The
doctor was bewildered and confounded, and he at last gave
up his inquiries in despair, hoping for a gracious verdict
from the jury at the trial.</p>

<p>Through all the weary time Mary kept closely at home,
secluded from friends and acquaintances. Indeed, visitors
were few in number now. She was in humble circumstances,
and she was in disgrace. Society always accounts its members
guilty until their innocence is proved. There were
people in the town who had been jealous of her beauty,
her popularity, her place in the affections of rich Tom Willitts,
and these did not hesitate to hint, with a sneer, that
<a class="pagenum" id="page_224">[Pg 224]</a>
they had always doubted the reported excellence of Mary
Engle, and to assert their belief in her guilt.</p>

<p>Tom Willitts was nearly crazed about her treatment of
him and the ignominy that was heaped upon her. With
Dr. Ricketts and Dick Newton, who professed intense anxiety
to help solve the matter, he strove valiantly to clear her
of the charge, but without avail.</p>

<p>The day of the trial came. The court-room was crowded.
Able lawyers on both sides sparred with each other, as able
lawyers do, but the heart of the prosecuting attorney was
evidently not with his work. His duty was clear, however,
and the evidence was overwhelming. The defence had
nothing to offer but Mary's good character and her appearance
before the company with the brooch upon her
person.</p>

<p>The judge was compelled to instruct the jury against the
prisoner. An hour of anxious suspense, and they returned
a verdict of "guilty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Engle began to sob violently. Mary drew her veil
aside from a face that was ashen white, but not a muscle
quivered until the judge pronounced the sentence:</p>

<p>"Costs of prosecution, a fine of one hundred dollars,
twenty lashes upon the bare back on the Saturday following,
and imprisonment for one year."</p>

<p>Mary fell to the floor insensible, and Dr. Ricketts, raising
her in his arms, applied restoratives. She was removed to
the jail to await her punishment.</p>

<p>The doctor mounted his horse and sped away in hot haste
forty miles to Dover. He had influence with the governor.
He would procure a pardon, and then have Mary taken
away from the scene of her tribulation&mdash;where her suffering
and disgrace would be forgotten, and she would be at peace.
He was unsuccessful. The governor was a just, not a merciful,
man. The law had been outraged. Twelve good men
<a class="pagenum" id="page_225">[Pg 225]</a>
and true had said so. If people committed crimes, they must
submit to the penalty. Society must be protected. The intelligence
and social position of the criminal only made the
demands of justice more imperative. If he pardoned Mary
Engle, men would rightly say that the poor and friendless
and weak were punished, while the influential and rich escaped
the law. He must do his duty to Delaware and to her
people. He could not grant the pardon.</p>

<p>But there was to be another appeal to executive mercy.
It was the night before the punishment. The doctor sat in his
parlor, before the glowing fire in the grate, and with his head
resting upon his hand he thought sadly of the pitiful scene
he had witnessed in the jail from which he had just come&mdash;of
Mary, in the damp, narrow cell, bearing herself like a
heroine through all this terrible trial, and still keeping a
secret which the doctor felt certain would give her back her
freedom and her good name if it could be disclosed; of Mrs.
Engle, full of despair and terror, crying bitterly over the
shame and disgrace that had come upon her child, and
which would be increased beyond endurance on the morrow.</p>

<p>As the doctor's kind old heart grew heavy with these
thoughts, and from the bewildering maze of circumstances he
tried to evolve some theory that promised salvation, Dick
Newton entered.</p>

<p>He was haggard and pale, and his eyes were cast down to
the floor.</p>

<p>"Why, Dick, what's the matter?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"Dr. Ricketts, I have come to make a shameful confession.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" said the doctor, suspiciously and impatiently, as
Dick's voice faltered.</p>

<p>"I will not hesitate about it," said Dick, hurriedly; "I
am afraid it is even now too late. I stole the diamond
brooch."</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_226">[Pg 226]</a></p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed the doctor, jumping to his feet in a
frenzy of indignant excitement.</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illus228.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"I am the cause of all this trouble. It was my fault that
Mary Engle was accused and convicted, and it will be my
fault if she is punished. Oh, doctor, cannot something be
done to save her? I never intended it should go so far."</p>

<p>"You infamous scoundrel!" said the doctor, unable
to restrain his scorn and contempt; "why did
you not say this before? Why did you permit all
this misery and shame to fall upon the defenceless
head of a woman for whom an honest man should have
sacrificed his very life? How was this villainy consummated?
Tell me, quickly!"</p>

<p>The poor wretch sank upon his knees, and with a trembling
voice exclaimed,</p>

<p>"I loved her. I hated Tom Willitts. He sent her a
bracelet. I knew it would come. I broke open father's
cabinet and took his brooch. With threats and money I
induced Tom's servant to lend me the box for a few moments
before he entered the house. I placed the brooch in it. She
thought it came from Tom, and she resolved to die rather
than betray him, although she thinks him the cause of her
ruin. It was vile and mean and wicked in me, but I thought
Tom would be the victim, not she; and when the trouble
came, I could not endure the shame of exposure. But you
will save her now, doctor, will you not? I will fly&mdash;leave
<a class="pagenum" id="page_227">[Pg 227]</a>
the country&mdash;kill myself&mdash;anything to prevent this awful
crime."</p>

<p>The miserable man burst into tears. Dr. Ricketts looked
at him a moment with eyes filled with pity and scorn, and
then said,</p>

<p>"So my theory was right, after all. Come, sir, you will
go to the governor with me, and we will see if he will grant
a pardon upon your confession."</p>

<p>"What, to-night?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Yes, to-night&mdash;now; and it will be well for you and
your victim if fleet horses carry us to Dover and back
before ten to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>In five minutes the pair were seated in a carriage, and
through the black night they sped onward, the one with his
heart swelling with hope, joy and humanity, the other cowering
in the darkness, full of misery and self-contempt, and
of horrible forebodings of the future.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Saturday morning&mdash;a cold, raw, gusty morning in May.</p>

<p>The town was in a small uproar. Men lounged on the
porches of the taverns, in front of which their horses were
hitched, talking politics, discussing crop prospects, the
prices of grain, the latest news by coach and schooner from
Philadelphia. Inside the bar-room men were reading newspapers
a month old, drinking, swearing and debating with
loud voices.</p>

<p>But the attraction that morning was in another quarter.
In the middle of the market street there was a common&mdash;a
strip of green sod twenty feet wide fringed on either side with
a row of trees. In the centre of this stood the whipping-post
and pillory.</p>

<p>The hour of ten tolled out from the steeple down the
street. It was the same bell that called the people together
on Sunday to worship God and to supplicate his mercy. It
<a class="pagenum" id="page_228">[Pg 228]</a>
was a bell of various uses. It summoned the saints to prayer
and the sinners to punishment.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus230.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>At its earliest stroke the jailer issued from the prison with
a forlorn-looking white man in his clutches. He hurried his
prisoner up the ladder, and prepared to fasten him in the pillory.
The boys below collected in knots, and fingered the missiles
in their hands. The jailer descended. A boy lifted his
hand and flung a rotten egg at the pilloried wretch. It hit
him squarely in the face, and the feculent contents streamed
down to his chin. That was the signal. Eggs, dead cats,
mud, stones, tufts of sod and a multitude of filthy things
were showered upon the prisoner, until the platform was
covered with the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. He yelled with pain, and strove
vainly to shake from his face the blood that streamed forth
from the cut skin and the filth that besmeared
it. The crowd hooted at him and
laughed at his efforts, and called him vile
names, and jested with him about his
wooden collar and cuffs, and no human
heart in all that assembly had any pity for him. For an
hour he stood there, enduring inconceivable torture. When
the steeple clock struck eleven, he was taken out in wretched
plight, almost helpless and sorely wounded. No more pillory
that day. It was the turn of the whipping-post now.
There were two women to be whipped, one of them white,
the other black. We know who the white woman was.</p>

<p>The negro was to suffer first. She was dragged from the jail
wild with fright and apprehension. Around her legs a soiled
skirt of calico dangled. About her naked body, stripped
for the sacrifice, a fragment of carpet was hung. The jailer
brought her by main force to the post through the jeering
crowd, and while she begged wildly, almost incoherently, for
mercy, promising vague, impossible things, the officer of the
law clasped the iron cuffs about her uplifted hands, so that
<a class="pagenum" id="page_229">[Pg 229]</a>
<a class="pagenum" id="page_231">[Pg 231]</a>
she was compelled to stand upon her toes to escape unendurable
agony. The blanket was torn from her shoulders, and
with dilated eyes glistening with terror, she turned her head
half around to where the sheriff stood, ready to execute the
law.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_230">[Pg 230]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus232.jpg" width="100%" alt="A FLOGGING SEVENTY YEARS AGO." title="A FLOGGING SEVENTY YEARS AGO." />
<h3>A FLOGGING SEVENTY YEARS AGO.</h3>
</div>

<p>This virtuous officer felt the sharp thongs of his "cat"
complacently as he listened with dull ear to the incessant
prayers of the woman; and when the jailer said, "Forty
lashes, sheriff," the cat was swung slowly up, and the ends
of the lashes touched the victim's back, bringing blood at the
first blow.</p>

<p>The crowd laughed and applauded. The sheriff accepted
the applause with the calm indifference of a man who feels
the greatness of his office and has confidence in his own
skill.</p>

<p>As the lashes came thick and fast, the skin swelled up
into thick purple ridges, and then the blood spurted out in
crimson streams, flowing down upon the wretched skirt and
staining it with a new and dreadful hue. The woman's
piercing screams rang out upon the air and filled some kind
hearts with tender pity. But as it was a "nigger," the tendency
to human kindness was smothered.</p>

<p>Beneath the blows she writhed and contorted and shrank
forward, until at last, faint with loss of blood, with terrible
pain and nervous exhaustion, she sank helplessly down and
hung by her arms alone. At first the sheriff thought he
would postpone the rest of the punishment until she recovered.
But there were only five more lashes to be given, and he concluded
that it would be as well to finish up the job. They
were inflicted upon the insensible form, and then the jailer
came forward with a pair of shears. The sheriff took them
coolly and clipped away a portion of the woman's ears. Her
hands were then unshackled; and bleeding, mutilated, unconscious,
she was carried into the prison.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_232">[Pg 232]</a></p>

<p>Her agonized cries had penetrated those walls already and
brought a whiter hue to the pale cheeks of the woman who
by this ignominy had learned her sisterhood with the poor
black. There were two other women in the cell, Mrs. Engle
and Mrs. Willitts. The former controlled herself for her
daughter's sake, but dared speak no word to her. Mrs.
Willitts, through her tears, tried to comfort Mary as with
hesitating hands she disrobed her for her torture:</p>

<p>"The day will come, Mary dear, when you will be vindicated,
and these wicked men will hide their heads with bitter
shame and humiliation. But bear up bravely, dear. Have
good courage through it all. Perhaps it will not be so hard.
'Though there be heaviness for a night, joy cometh in the
morning.' We will all be happy together yet some day."</p>

<p>Mary Engle stood there, speechless, statue-like, immovable,
as they took away her garments, and her fair white
skin glistened in the dim light.</p>

<p>It was almost time. The black woman was being dragged
through the door to the next cell. The murmur of the crowd
came up from the street. Mrs. Willitts placed the blanket
upon those ivory shoulders, and Mary, turning to her mother,
flung her arms about her and kissed her. In a whisper
she said,</p>

<p>"I shall die, mother. I will not live through it. I will
never see you again."</p>

<p>But there was not a tear in her eye. Wrapping the blanket
tightly about her, with the calmness of despair she prepared
to step from the cell at the call of the impatient jailer.</p>

<p>A great commotion in the streets. The noise of horse's
hoofs. A din of voices; then a wild cheer.</p>

<p>Dr. Ricketts dashed in, flourishing a paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"She is pardoned! pardoned!" he shouted; "go back!
take her back!" he said as the jailer laid his hand upon
Mary. "See this!" and he flung the paper open in his face.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_233">[Pg 233]</a></p>

<p>The long agony was over, and the reaction was so great
that Mary Engle, hardly conscious of the good thing that
had happened to her, and not fully realizing the events by
which her innocence was proved, stood stupefied and bewildered.
Then she felt faint, and laying her upon the low
bed, they told her all the story; and when the doctor said
that Tom was not a guilty man, she turned her face to the
wall to hide the blinding tears, and she muttered:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus235.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Thank God! thank God for that!"</p>

<p>As she came out of the prison doors, leaning on the doctor's
arm, the crowd, now largely increased, hailed her with
a hurrah, but Mary drew her veil over her face and shuddered
as she thought how these very people had assembled
to see her flogged.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_234">[Pg 234]</a></p>

<p>"It is my theory, my dear," said the doctor, "that human
beings are equally glad when their fellow-creatures get into
trouble and when they get out of it."</p>

<p>Back once again in her old home, Mary was besieged by
friends whose regard had suddenly assumed a violent form,
and who were now eager to congratulate her upon her vindication.</p>

<p>Tom Willitts came to the door and inquired for Mrs.
Engle.</p>

<p>"Can I come in now?" he inquired, with a glow upon his
face.</p>

<p>He did go in, and there, before them all, he clasped Mary
in his arms, while she begged him to forgive her for all the
suffering she had caused him.</p>

<p>But Tom wanted to be forgiven, too; and as both confessed
guilt, repentance and an earnest wish to be merciful, they
were soon better friends than ever.</p>

<p>"I used to love you," said Tom, "but now I worship you
for your heroism and your sacrifice for me."</p>

<p>There was another visitor. Old Major Newton entered
the room, hat in hand, and with bowed head. The lines in
his face were deeper and harder than usual, but he looked
broken and sad.</p>

<p>He went up to Mary and said as he stood before her with
downcast eyes:</p>

<p>"I have come to ask pardon for my brutality and cruelty.
The injury I did to you I can never atone for. I shall carry
my remorse to the grave. But if you have any word of pity
for an old man whose son has fled from home a scoundrel
and a villain, and who stands before you broken-hearted,
ready to kiss your feet for your angelic goodness and your
noble self-sacrifice, say it, that I may at least have that
comfort in my desolation."</p>

<p>And Mary took the old man's hard hands in hers and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_235">[Pg 235]</a>
spoke kind and gentle words to him; and with tears coursing
down his rough cheeks, he kissed
her dainty fingers and went out,
and back to his forlorn and wretched home.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus237.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>There was another Christmas night a few months later, and
this time the merry-making was going on in the Willitts mansion.
There were two brides there. Mary and Tom Willitts were
busy helping the children with their Christmas games, and
keeping up the excitement as if no sorrow had ever come
across their path; while seated at the upper end of the room,
Dr. Ricketts and his wife (Mrs. Engle that had been), looking
upon the younger pair with pride and pleasure, touched only
now and then with a sad memory of the troubled times that
were gone by for ever.</p>

<p>And when the games were all in full progress, Tom and
his wife watched them for a while, and then he drew her
arm through his, and they went to the porch and looked out
upon the river beating up against the ice-bound shore, just
as it did on that night one year ago. But it had a different
language to Mary's ears now. It was full of music, but
music that seemed in a minor key, as the remembrance
of that wild flight along the shore came up vividly in her
mind.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a while, but each knew that the thoughts
of the other went over all the misery and terror of the past,
only to rest satisfied with the calm, sweet happiness of the
present. Mary, clasping her husband's arm tighter in her
grasp, looked with unconscious eyes out over the broad
river, while her lips slowly repeated that grand old hymn of
comfort and hope:</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_236">[Pg 236]</a></p>

<ol>
<li>"There is a day of peace and rest</li>
  <li class="i2">For sorrow's dark and dreary night;</li>
<li>Though grief may bide an evening guest,</li>
  <li class="i2">Yet joy shall come with morning light.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>"The light of smiles shall beam again</li>
  <li class="i2">From lids that now o'erflow with tears,</li>
<li>And weary days of woe and pain</li>
  <li class="i2">Are earnests of serener years."</li>

</div>

<p>Last evening, after waiting until eleven o'clock for Mr. Parker
to come home, I went to bed. I had hardly composed myself
for slumber when I thought I heard the door-bell ring; and
supposing Bob had forgotten his latch-key, I descended for
the purpose of letting him in. When I opened the door, no
one was upon the porch; and although I was dressed simply
in a night-shirt, I stepped out just beyond the doorway for
the purpose of ascertaining if
I could see any one who might have pulled the bell. Just
as I did so the wind banged the door shut, and as it closed
it caught a portion of my raiment which was fluttering
about, and held it fast. I was somewhat amused at first,
and I laughed as I tried to pull the muslin from the door;
but after making very violent exertion for that purpose, I
<a class="pagenum" id="page_238">[Pg 238]</a>
discovered that the material would not slip through. The
garment was held so firmly that it could not possibly be removed.
Then I determined to
reach over to the other side of
the doorway and pull the bell, in
the hope that some one would
hear it and come to my assistance.
But to my dismay I
found that the doorway was so
wide that even with the most
desperate effort I could not succeed
in touching the bell-knob
with the tips of my fingers.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus240a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Meantime, I was beginning to freeze, for the night was very
cold, and my legs and feet were wholly unprotected.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus240b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>At last a happy thought
struck me. I might very
easily creep out of the shirt
and leave it hanging in the
door until I rang the bell,
and then I could slip back
again and await the result.
Accordingly, I began to
withdraw from the garment,
and I had just freed
myself from it and was
about to pull the bell when
I heard some one coming
down the street. As the
moon was shining brightly,
I became panic-stricken,
and hurried into the garment again. In my confusion I got
<a class="pagenum" id="page_239">[Pg 239]</a>
it on backward, and found myself with my face to the wall;
and then the person who was coming turned down the street
just above my house, and didn't
pass, after all.</p>

<div class="figright w25">

</div>

<p>I was afraid to try the experiment again, and I determined
to shout for help. I uttered one cry, and waited for a
response. It was a desperately cold night. I think the air
must have been colder than it ever was before in the history
of this continent. I stamped my feet in order to keep the
blood in circulation, and then I shouted again for assistance.
The river lay white and glistening in the light of the moon,
and so clear was the atmosphere, so lustrous the radiance of
the orb above, that I could plainly distinguish the dark line
of the Jersey shore. It was a magnificent spectacle, and I
should have enjoyed it intensely if I had had my clothing on.
Then I began to think how very odd it was that a man's
appreciation of the glorious majesty of nature should be
dependent upon his trousers! how strange it was that cold
legs should prevent an immortal soul from having felicity!
Man is always prosaic when he is uncomfortable. Even a slight
indigestion is utterly destructive of sentiment. I defy any man
<a class="pagenum" id="page_240">[Pg 240]</a>
to enjoy the fruitiest poetry while his corns hurt him, or to
feel a genuine impulse of affection while he has a severe cold
in his head.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus242a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Then I cried aloud again for help, and an immediate response
came from Cooley's new dog, which leaped over the
fence and behaved as if it meditated an assault upon my
defenceless calves. I was relieved from this dreadful
situation by Bob, who came up the street whistling and
singing in an especially joyous manner. He was a
little frightened, I think, when he saw a figure in
white upon the porch, and he paused for a moment before
opening the gate, but he entered when I called to
him; and unlocking the door with his key, he released me,
and went up stairs laughing heartily at my mishap.</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus242b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>I was about to retire when I heard a series of extraordinary
sounds in Bob's room overhead, and I thought it worth while
to go up and ascertain what was going on. Standing outside
the door, I could hear Bob chuckling
and making use of such exclamations as,</p>

<p>"Bul-l-<i>e-e-e</i>! Ha! ha! All right, my
boy! All right! You've fixed that, I guess!
Bul-l-<i>e-e-e-e-e</i>!"</p>

<p>Then he seemed to be executing a hornpipe
in his stockings upon the carpet; and when this
exercise was concluded, he continued the conversation
with himself in such tones as these:</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_241">[Pg 241]</a></p>

<p>"How <i>are</i> <span class="smcap">you</span>, Smiley! No chance, hadn't I? Couldn't
make it, couldn't I? I know a thing or two, I reckon.
How <i>are</i> <span class="smcap">you</span>, Lieutenant
Smil-<i>e-e-e-e</i>! Ha! ha! I've settled your case, I guess,
my boy! Bully for you, Parker! You've straightened
that out, anyhow. Yes, sir! Ha! ha! Fol de rol de
rol de rol," etc., etc. (second performance of the hornpipe,
accompanied by whistling and new expressions of intense satisfaction).</p>

<div class="figright w50">
<img src="images/illus243a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>I went down stairs with a
solemn conviction that Mr.
Parker had explained himself to Miss Magruder, and had
received an answer from her that was wholly satisfactory.
I did not reveal the secret to Mrs. Adeler,
concluding that it would be better to permit Bob
to do that himself in the morning.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus243b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Parker rose about two hours earlier than usual,
and I entertain a suspicion that he expended a portion of
the time in going down the street to examine
the exterior of Mr. Magruder's house. It
probably gave him some satisfaction merely to
view the tenement wherein his fair enslaver
reposed. He came to the breakfast-table with
a radiant countenance, and it was evident that
he would be unable to contain the news for
many moments longer. In order to prepare
the way for him, I asked him:</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus243c.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Why were you so late last night, Bob?"</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_242">[Pg 242]</a></p>

<p>"Oh, I had some important business on hand. Big things
have been happening; I have some news to tell you."</p>

<p>"Another railroad accident?" I asked, carelessly, "or a
riot in Philadelphia?"</p>

<p>"Riot? no! Thunder!" exclaimed Bob; "nothing of
that kind. It's something more important. You know old
Smiley&mdash;Fiji Island Smiley? Well, I've floored him; I've
laid him out flat; I've knocked him into diminutive smithereens."</p>

<p>"Had a personal encounter with the lieutenant?" I asked,
gravely.</p>

<p>"No, <i>sir</i>! better than that. I've cut him out down at
Magruder's. Bessie and I are engaged! What do you
think of that, Max?"</p>

<p>"Think of it? Why, I congratulate you heartily. You
have secured a treasure."</p>

<p>"And I congratulate you, too," said Mrs. A. "Bessie is
a very fine girl, and will make you a good wife."</p>

<p>"That's what I think about it," observed Mr. Parker.</p>

<p>"I am very glad Lieutenant Smiley didn't succeed there,"
said Mrs. A.</p>

<p>"Smiley! Smiley!" exclaimed Bob, scornfully. "Why,
he never had the ghost of a chance. Bessie told me last
night she despised him. She wouldn't look at such a man
as he is."</p>

<p>"Not while such men as you are around, at any rate, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"When are you going to speak to Bessie's father?" asked
Mrs. Adeler.</p>

<p>A cloud suddenly passed over Bob's face, and he said:</p>

<p>"I don't know. I have to do it, I s'pose, but I hate it
worse than I can tell you. I believe I'd rather propose to
a woman a dozen times than to broach the matter to a stern
parent once. It's all well enough to express your feelings
<a class="pagenum" id="page_243">[Pg 243]</a>
to a woman who loves you; but when you come to explain
the matter to a cold-blooded, matter-of-fact old man who is
as prosy as a boiled turnip, it seems kind of ridiculous."</p>

<p>"Why don't you speak to Mrs. Dr. Magruder, then? She
is a power in that family."</p>

<p>"No; I'll talk to Mr. Magruder. It's hard, but it has to
be done. And see here, Max, don't you poke fun at Mrs.
Magruder. She's a first-rate woman, and those things Dr.
Jones told about her are the most rascally kind of lies. If
you'll excuse me, I'll go down and see the old man now. I
might as well settle the thing at once."</p>

<p>This evening, while we were waiting for tea, Bob made a
report. The paternal Magruder, it seems, had already considered
the subject carefully, and was not by any means as
much surprised by Mr. Parker's statement as the latter expected
he would be. Bob was amazed to find that although
the old gentleman during the courtship had appeared wholly
unconscious of the fact that his daughter was particularly
intimate with the youth, yet somehow he seemed now to
have had all the time a very clear perception of the state of
the case.</p>

<p>"I thought he would get excited and, maybe, show a little
emotion," said Bob, "but blame me if he didn't sit there
and take it as coolly as if such things happened to him every
day. And you know, when I began to tell him how much I
thought of Bessie, he soused down on me and brought me
back to prose with a question about the size of my income.
But it's all right. He said he would be glad to have me a
member of his family, and then he called in Bessie, and gave
us a kind of a blessing and advised us not to be in a hurry
about getting married."</p>

<p>"Very good advice, too. There is no need of haste.
You ought to have plenty of time to think the matter
over."</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_244">[Pg 244]</a></p>

<p>"Think it over!" exclaimed Bob, indignantly. "Why, I
<i>have</i> thought it over. You don't suppose I'd be such a
fool as to engage myself to a girl without thinking seriously
about it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; but marriage is a very solemn thing, and
it should be undertaken advisedly. It is probable, I suppose,
that you would never, under any circumstances, marry
any woman but Bessie Magruder?"</p>

<p>"Nev-er; no, never!"</p>

<p>"You don't believe in second marriages, then?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus246a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"They <i>do</i> get a man into trouble very often. Did I ever
tell you about old Sparks, of Pencadder Hundred?"</p>

<p>"I think not," said Bob.</p>
<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus246b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Well, old Sparks was married four times; and several
years after the death of his last wife they started a new cemetery
up there at Pencadder. Sparks bought a lot, and determined to remove his sacred dust
from the old graveyard. Somehow or other, in taking the remains over
to the cemetery in the wagon, they were hopelessly mixed together,
so that it was utterly impossible to tell which was which. Any other
man than Sparks would
<a class="pagenum" id="page_245">[Pg 245]</a>
simply have taken the chances of having the reinterments
properly made. But he was an extremely conscientious
man; and when the sepulture was completed, he had a lot of
new headstones set in, bearing such inscriptions as these:
'Here lies Jane (and probably part of Susan) Sparks;'
'Sacred to the memory of Maria (to say nothing of Jane
and Hannah) Sparks.'</p>

<ol>
<li>"'Stranger, pause and drop a tear,</li>
<li>For Susan Sparks lies buried here;</li>
<li>Mingled, in some perplexing manner,</li>
<li>With Jane, Maria and portions of Hannah.'"</li>
</ol>

<p>"Don't it seem a little bit rough," said Bob, "to bring in
such a story as that in connection with my engagement? I
don't like it."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Bob. Perhaps it was neither gracious nor
in good taste, but somehow I just happened to think of old
Sparks at that moment, I am sure, though, you won't object
to another narrative which I am going to read to you upon
the subject of too frequent marriage. It is the story of Bishop
Potts. Do you feel like hearing it?"</p>

<p>"Well, no," said Bob, gloomily, "to tell you the truth, I
don't; but I suppose I will have to hear it, so go ahead."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am going to inflict it upon you whether you want
it or not. A man who is meditating matrimony, and is in
a hurry, needs the influence of a few 'awful examples' to
induce him to proceed slowly. Here is the story. The
hero was a dignitary in the Mormon Church, and his sufferings
were the result of excessive marriage. The tale is
entitled</p>

<h2>"<span class="smcap">Bishop Potts</span>.</h2>

<p>"Bishop Potts, of Salt Lake City, was the husband of
three wives and the father of fifteen interesting children.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_246">[Pg 246]</a>
Early in the winter the bishop determined that his little ones should
have a good time on Christmas, so he concluded to take a trip down
to San Francisco to see what he could find in the shape of toys with
which to gratify and amuse them. The good bishop packed his carpet-bag,
embraced Mrs. Potts one by one and kissed each of her affectionately,
and started upon his journey.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus248a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"He was gone a little more than
a week, when he came back with
fifteen brass trumpets in his valise
for his darlings. He got out of the train at Salt Lake,
thinking how joyous it would be at home on Christmas
morning when the fifteen trumpets should be in operation
upon different tunes at the same moment. But just as he
entered the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t he saw a group of women standing in the
ladies' room apparently waiting for him. As soon as he
approached, the whole twenty of them rushed up, threw
their arms about his neck and kissed him, exclaiming:</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus248b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"'Oh, Theodore, we are so, <i>so</i> glad you have come
back!  Welcome home Welcome, dear Theodore, to the bosom of your family!'
and then the entire score of them fell upon his neck and
cried over his shirt front and mussed him.'</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_247">[Pg 247]</a></p>

<p>"The bishop seemed surprised and embarrassed. Struggling
to disengage himself, he blushed and said:</p>

<p>"'Really, ladies, this kind of thing is well enough&mdash;it is
interesting and all that; but there must be some kind of a&mdash;that
is, an awkward sort of a&mdash;excuse me, ladies, but
there seems to be, as it were, a slight misunderstanding
about the&mdash;I am Bishop Potts.'</p>

<p>"'We know it, we know it, dear,' they exclaimed, in
chorus, 'and we are glad to see you safe at home. We have
all been very well while you were away, love.'</p>

<p>"'It gratifies me,' remarked the bishop, 'to learn that
none of you have been a prey to disease. I am filled with
serenity when I contemplate the fact; but really, I do not
understand why you should rush into this railway station
and hug me because your livers are active and your digestion
good. The precedent is bad; it is dangerous!'</p>

<p>"'Oh, but we didn't!' they exclaimed, in chorus. 'We
came here to welcome you because you are our husband.'</p>

<p>"'Pardon me, but there must be some little&mdash;that is to
say, as it were, I should think not. Women, you have mistaken
your man!'</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus249.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"'Oh no!' they shouted; 'we were married to you while you were away!'</p>

<p>"'What!' exclaimed the bishop; 'you don't mean to say that&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Yes, love. Our husband,
William Brown, died on Monday,
and on Thursday, Brigham had
a vision in which he was directed
to seal us to you; and so he performed
the ceremony at once by proxy.'</p>

<p>"'Th-th-th-th-under!' observed the bishop.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_248">[Pg 248]</a></p>

<p>"'And we are all living with you now&mdash;me and the dear
children.'</p>

<p>"'Children! children!' exclaimed Bishop Potts, turning
pale; 'you don't mean to say that there is a pack of children,
too?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, love, but only one hundred and twenty-five, not
counting the eight twins and the triplet.'</p>

<p>"'Wha-wha-wha-what d'you say?' gasped the bishop, in
a cold perspiration; 'one hundred and twenty-five! One
hundred and twenty-five children and twenty more wives!
It is too much&mdash;it is awful!' and the bishop sat down and
groaned, while the late Mrs. Brown, the bride, stood around
in a semicircle and fanned him with her bonnets, all except
the red-haired one, and she in her trepidation made a futile
effort to fan him with the coal-scuttle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus250.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"But after a while the bishop became reconciled to his
new alliance, knowing well that protests would be unavailing,
so he walked home, holding several of the little hands
of the bride, while the red-haired woman carried his umbrella
and marched in front of the parade to remove obstructions
and to scare off small boys.</p>

<p>"When the bishop reached the house, he went around
among the cradles which filled the back parlor and the two
second-story rooms, and attempted with such earnestness to
become acquainted with his new sons and daughters that he
set the whole one hundred and twenty-five and the twins to
crying, while his own original fifteen stood around and
swelled the volume of sound. Then the bishop went out
<a class="pagenum" id="page_249">[Pg 249]</a>
and sat on the garden fence to whittle a stick
and solemnly think, while Mrs. Potts distributed
herself around and soothed the children.
It occurred to the bishop while he mused, out
there on the fence, that he had not enough
trumpets to go around among the children as the family
now stood; and so, rather than seem to be partial, he determined
to go back to San Francisco for one hundred and
forty-four more.</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus251a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"So the bishop repacked his carpet-bag, and began again
to bid farewell to his family. He tenderly kissed all of the
Mrs. Potts who were at home, and started for the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t,
while Mrs. Potts stood at the various windows and waved
her handkerchiefs at him&mdash;all except the woman with the
warm hair, and she, in a fit of absent-mindedness, held one
of the twins by the leg and brandished it at Potts as he
fled down the street toward the railway station.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus251b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"The bishop reached San
Francisco, completed his purchases,
and was just about to
get on the train with his one
hundred and forty-four trumpets,
when a telegram was handed him. It contained information
to the effect that the auburn-haired Mrs. Potts
had just had a daughter. This induced the bishop to
return to the city for the purpose of purchasing an additional
trumpet.</p>

<p>"On the following Saturday he returned home. As he
approached his house a swarm of young children flew out
of the front gate and ran toward him, shouting, 'There's pa!
<a class="pagenum" id="page_250">[Pg 250]</a>
Here comes pa! Oh, pa, but we're glad to see you! Hurrah
for pa!' etc., etc.</p>

<p>"The bishop looked at the children as they flocked
around him and clung to his legs and coat, and was astonished
to perceive that they were neither his nor the late
Brown's. He said, 'You youngsters have made a mistake;
I am not your father;' and the bishop smiled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"'Oh yes, you are, though!' screamed the little ones, in
chorus.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus252.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"'But I say I am not,' said the bishop, severely, and
frowning; 'you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Don't
you know where little story-tellers go? It is scandalous
<a class="pagenum" id="page_251">[Pg 251]</a>
for you to violate the truth in this manner. My name is
Potts.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, we know it is,' exclaimed the children&mdash;'we know
it is, and so is ours; that is our name now, too, since the
wedding.'</p>

<p>"'Since what wedding?' demanded the bishop, turning
pale.</p>

<p>"'Why, ma's wedding, of course. She was married yesterday
to you by Mr. Young, and we are all living at your
house now with our new little brothers and sisters.'</p>

<p>"The bishop sat down on the nearest front-door step and
wiped away a tear. Then he asked,</p>

<p>"'Who was your father?'</p>

<p>"'Mr. Simpson,' said the crowd, 'and he died on Tuesday.'</p>

<p>"'And how many of his infernal old widows&mdash;I mean how
many of your mother&mdash;are there?'</p>

<p>"'Only twenty-seven,' replied the children, 'and there are
only sixty-four of us, and we are awful glad you have come
home.'</p>

<p>"The bishop did not seem to be unusually glad; somehow,
he failed to share the enthusiasm of the occasion. There appeared
to be, in a certain sense, too much sameness about
these surprises; so he sat there with his hat pulled over his
eyes and considered the situation. Finally, seeing there was
no help for it, he went up to the house, and forty-eight of
Mrs. Potts rushed up to him and told him how the prophet
had another vision, in which he was commanded to seal
Simpson's widow to Potts.</p>

<p>"Then the bishop stumbled around among the cradles to
his writing-desk. He felt among the gum rings and rattles
for his letter-paper, and then he addressed a note to Brigham,
asking him as a personal favor to keep awake until after
Christmas. 'The man must take me for a foundling hospital,'
<a class="pagenum" id="page_252">[Pg 252]</a>
he said. Then the bishop saw clearly enough that if he
gave presents to the other
children, and not to the late
Simpson's, the bride would
make things warm for
him. So he started again
for San Francisco for sixty-four
more trumpets, while
Mrs. Potts gradually took
leave of him in the entry&mdash;all
but the red-haired woman,
who was up stairs, and
who had to be satisfied with
screeching good-bye at the
top of her voice.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus254.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"On his way home, after
his last visit to San Francisco,
the bishop sat in the car by the side of a man who had left
Salt Lake the day before. The stranger was communicative.
In the course of the conversation he remarked to the
bishop:</p>

<p>"'That was a mighty pretty little affair up there at the
city on Monday.'</p>

<p>"'What affair?' asked Potts.</p>

<p>"'Why, that wedding; McGrath's widow, you know&mdash;married
by proxy.'</p>

<p>"'You don't say?' replied the bishop. 'I didn't know
McGrath was dead.'</p>

<p>"'Yes; died on Sunday, and that night Brigham had a
vision in which he was ordered to seal her to the bishop.'</p>

<p>"'Bishop!' exclaimed Potts. 'Bishop! What bishop?'</p>

<p>"'Well, you see, there were fifteen of Mrs. McGrath and
eighty-two children, and they shoved the whole lot off on old
Potts. Perhaps you don't know him?'</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_253">[Pg 253]</a></p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus255a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"The bishop gave a wild shriek and writhed upon the floor as if he
had a fit. When he recovered, he leaped from the train and walked
back to San Francisco. He afterward took the first steamer for Peru,
where he entered a monastery and became a celibate.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus255b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus255c.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"His carpet-bag was sent on to his family. It contained
the balance of the trumpets. On Christmas
morning they were distributed, and in less than
an hour the entire two hundred and eight children
were sick from sucking the brass upon
them. A doctor was called, and he seemed so
much interested in the family that Brigham divorced the
whole concern from old Potts and annexed it to the doctor, who
immediately lost his reason, and would have butchered the entire
family if the red-haired woman and the oldest boy had not marched
him off to a lunatic asylum, where he spent his time trying to
arrive at an estimate of the number
of his children by ciphering with an impossible combination
of the multiplication table and algebra."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"And now that that's over," said Bob, as I folded up the
manuscript, "will you please to tell me what the suffering
of old Potts has to do with my engagement?"</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth, nothing in particular. I thought
<a class="pagenum" id="page_254">[Pg 254]</a>
perhaps you might feel a sort of general interest in the mere
subject of matrimony just now; and at any rate, I wanted
your opinion of the merit of the story."</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus256a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Well, I think it is a pretty poor story. The humor of
the Mormon business is stale, anyhow, and in your hands it becomes
absolutely dismal. I can write a better Mormon story than
that myself, and I don't even profess to be a scribbler."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Parker swaggered
out with the air of a man whose
opinions have the weight of a judicial
decision. I think he has
acquired, since his engagement,
a much greater notion of his importance
than he had before. It
is remarkable how a youth who
has succeeded in a love affair immediately begins to cherish
the idea that his victory is attributable to the fact that he
possesses particularly brilliant qualities of some kind. Bob
was the humblest man in Delaware a week ago; to-day he
walks about with such an air as he might have had if he
had just won the battle of Waterloo.</p>

<p>When the people of our village
are in the mood to reflect
upon antiquity, when
they feel as if they would
like to meditate upon the
heroic deeds that have been
achieved in this kindly old
place by the mighty men of
valor who swaggered and
swore and fought here a
hundred years before the
war of the Revolution was
dreamed of, they turn from
the street down the gentle
slope of the highway which
runs by the river; and when they have wandered on a brief
distance beyond the present confines of the town, they reach
old Fort Lane. It is but a little stretch of greensward,
gashed by the wheels of vehicles and trodden by the feet of
wayfarers. It extends from the road eastward for a hundred
yards, and then it dips downward and ends upon the sandy
beach of the stream. Here, right upon the edge of the water,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_256">[Pg 256]</a>
once stood brave old Fort Kasimir, with its guns threatening
destruction not only to unfriendly vessels which sailed up
the bay, but absolutely menacing the very town itself. The
village then was called New Stockholm. That was the name
given to it by the Swedes, who perceived what a superb site
for a city lay here, and who went to work and built a swarm
of snug wooden houses. It has had half a dozen other names
since. When the Dutchmen conquered it, they dubbed it
Sandhoec, then New Amstel and then Fort Kasimir. Afterward
it was known as Grape Wine Point, then as Delaware-town
and finally as New Castle. But twenty years after the
Swedes had settled here, the Dutchmen at New York coveted
the place and the command of the river; and as an earnest
of what they intended to do, they came right here under the
very noses of the villagers and built Fort Kasimir.</p>

<p>I can imagine how the old Swedes in the village stood
over there on the Battery and glowered at the Dutchmen as
they labored upon the fort; and it is not difficult to conceive
the terror and dismay that filled those humble little homes
in New Stockholm when the intruder placed his queer brass
cannon in the embrasures of the fort after its completion,
and when he would hurl a ball across the bows of a Swedish
ship coming up to the town, or would send a shot whistling
over the roofs of the village itself merely to gratify a grim
humor. I would give a great deal, Mrs. Adeler, to have
but one day of that distant past recalled; to see New Stockholm
and its people as they were; to watch the Dutch chieftain
and his handful of men parading about in the fort in
the panoply of war, and boasting of the prowess that dared
thus to defy the enemy upon his own threshold. But, alas!
look! not one vestige of the ancient battlements remains.
The grass has grown over the spot whereon they stood, and
the rolling river has long since buried beneath the sand of its
shores whatever timbers of the structure touched its waters.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_259">[Pg 259]</a></p>

<p>It would have been forgotten, perhaps, but that Irving, with
the humorous pen which traced the history of the Knickerbockers,
has given it immortality in the lines that tell how
the exasperated Swedes seized the fort and held the Dutchmen
prisoners, and how, when the news came to Manhattan
island, the Dutch sent forth a valiant army, which not only
retook the fortress, but carried away nearly all the villagers.</p>

<h3>THE SITE OF FORT KASIMIR.</h3>
</div>

<p>There was wild lamentation in the little community upon
that day as the unhappy people were torn from their homes
and sent into exile; and though the historian tells his tale
sportively, the story always seemed to me to be full of
pathos.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus261.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>This place was thronged with strange figures, and it witnessed
some very sad scenes in that far-off time. And if the
traditions of the neighborhood may be believed, those tough
old warriors even yet have not bid farewell for ever to the
spot. There is no more fighting here, unless when some of
the village urchins come out to
have a tussle upon the sward,
and the chimneys of the town are
unmolested by hostile shot. But
they do say that sometimes we
may look upon the shadowy outline
of the ancient Hollanders
who made this their battleground.
The venturesome wight who comes
to old Fort Lane at certain seasons
after nightfall may see headless
Dutchmen in strange and ghostly
attire marching up and down the shore, and he may hear
the cry of sentinels, uttered in an unknown tongue, borne
past him on the wind. There are those who have listened
to the noise of cannon balls rolling in the dusk over floors
which no mortal eye can ever see, and often, when there
<a class="pagenum" id="page_260">[Pg 260]</a>
is a tempest, the booming of
guns will be heard above the
roar of the storm, and from
spectral ships floating upon the
bosom of the river will come
the wailing voices of women
and children who are still sorrowing
for their lost homes.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus262a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>I do not say that this is so, Mrs. Adeler; I merely assert
the existence of a popular theory to that effect. I have private
doubts if the goblin Dutchmen ever have been seen, and I
know of no reason why, if a ghost of that kind really comes back to earth, he should return
without his head.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus262b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Judge Pitman has a field that is bounded upon one side
by the lane, and in this enclosure we found, upon our visit
to the historic spot, a meditative cow with a blind-board
upon her forehead. There was nothing especially
remarkable about the board, and yet it has caused
a great deal of trouble. In a recent interview with
me the judge sought to console himself for the misery
created by that blind-board by relating the story
of his sorrow.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus263a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Adeler," he said, "you know I j'ined the temp'rance
society a couple o' months ago, not because I was much
<a class="pagenum" id="page_261">[Pg 261]</a>
afeared of gittin' drunk often, but just to please the old
woman. You know how women are&mdash;kinder insane on the subject
of drinkin'. Well, my cow had a way o' jumpin' the fence, an' I
couldn't do nothin' to stop her. She was the ornariest critter that
way that I ever see. So at last I got a blind-board an' hung it on
her horns. That stopped her.
But you know she used to come jam up agin' the fence an'
stand there for hours; an' one day one o' them vagabone
advertisin' agents come along&mdash;one o' them fellers that daubs
signs all over the face of natur'&mdash;an' as soon as he seen that
blind-board he went for it."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus263b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"A patent medicine man, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, he was advertisin' some kind o' stomach bitters; and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_262">[Pg 262]</a>
he painted on that board the follerin': '<i>Take Brown's Bitters
for your Stomach's Sake. They make the Best Cocktails.</i>'"</p>

<p>"The temperance society didn't like that, of course?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>sir</i>! The secretary happened to see it, and he
brought out the board of directors; and the fust thing I
knowed, they hauled me up an' wanted to expel me for circulatin'
scand'lous information respectin' bitters an' cocktails."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus264a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"That was very unjust."</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus264b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Well, sir, I had the hardest time to make them fellers
understand that I was innercent, an' to git 'em to let up on
me. But they did. Then I turned the blind-board over;
and now the first man I ketch placin' any revolutionary sentiments
on the frontispiece of that cow, why, down goes
his house; I'll knock the stuffin'
out o' him; now mind <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>"I am usually not in favor of
resort to violence judge; but I
must say that under the circumstances
even such severity would
be perfectly justifiable."</p>

<p>"This bitters business is kinder
fraudulent anyway," continued
the judge, meditatively. "I once
had a very cur'ous experience drinkin' that stuff. Last
winter I read in one of the papers an advertisement which
said&mdash; But hold on; I'll read it to you. I've got 'em all. I
<a class="pagenum" id="page_263">[Pg 263]</a>
kep' 'em as a cur'osity. Let's
see; where d' I put them things?
Ah! yes; here they are;" and
the judge produced some newspaper
cuttings from his pocket-book.
"Well, sir, I read in
the <i>Argus</i> this parergraph:</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus265a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<blockquote><p>"'The excessive moisture and the extreme cold and continuous
dampness of winter are peculiarly deleterious to the human
system, and colds, consumption and death are very apt to ensue
unless the body is braced by some stimulating tonic such as
Blank's Bitters, which give tone to the stomach, purify
the blood, promote digestion and increase the appetite.
The Bitters are purely medicinal, and they contain no intoxicating
element.'</p></blockquote>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus265b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"I'd been kinder oneasy the winter afore about my health,
and this skeered me. So I drank them Bitters all through
the cold weather; an' when spring come, I was just about to knock
off an' begin agin on water, when I was wuss frightened than ever
to see in the <i>Argus</i> the followin':</p>

<blockquote><p>"'The sudden changes of temperature which are characteristic
of the spring, and the enervating influence of the increased heat,
make the season one of peculiar danger to the human system, so
that ague, fever and diseases resulting from impurities clogging
the circulation of the blood can only be avoided by giving tone
<a class="pagenum" id="page_264">[Pg 264]</a>
to the stomach and increasing the powers of that organ by a
liberal use of Blank's Bitters.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"I thought there wa'n't no use takin' any risks, so I begun
agin; but I made up my mind to stop drinkin' when summer
come an' danger was over."</p>

<p>"Your confidence in those advertisements, judge, was
something wonderful."</p>

<p>"Jes so. Well, about the fust of June, while I was a-finishin'
the last bottle I had, I seen in the <i>Argus</i> this one.
Jes lissen to this:</p>

<blockquote><p>"'The violent heat of summer debilitates and weakens
the human system so completely that, more easily than at
any other time, it becomes a prey to the insidious diseases
which prevail during what may fairly be called the sickly
season. The sacrifice of human life during this dangerous
period would be absolutely frightful had not Nature and Art
offered a sure preventive in Blank's Bitters, which give tone
to the stomach,' etc., etc.</p></blockquote>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illus266.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"This seemed like such a solemn warnin' that I hated to
let it go; an' so I bought a dozen more bottles an' took
another turn. I begun to think that some mistake
'd been made in gittin' up a climate for
this yer country, and it did seem astonishin'
that Blank should be the only man who knew
how to correct the error.
Howsomdever, I determined to quit in the fall, when the
sickly season was over, an' I was jes gittin' ready to quit
when the <i>Argus</i> published another one of them notices.
Here it is:</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_265">[Pg 265]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>"'The miasmatic vapors with which the atmosphere is
filled during the fall of the year break down the human
system and destroy life with a frightful celerity which is
characteristic of no other season, unless the stomach is
strengthened by constant use of Blank's Bitters, which are
a sure preventive of disease,' etc., etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>"But they didn't fool me that time. No, sir. I took the
chances with those asthmatic vapors, and let old Blank rip.
I j'ined the temperance society, an' here I am, hearty as a
buck."</p>

<p>"You look extremely well."</p>

<p>"But, Adeler, I never bore no grudge agin the bitters
men for lyin' until they spread their owdacious falsehoods
on the blind-board of my cow. Then it did 'pear 's if they
was crowdin' me too hard."</p>

<p>"Judge, did you ever try to convert Cooley to temperance
principles? It seems to me that he would be a good subject
to work upon."</p>

<p>"Well, no; I never said nothin' to him on the subject.
I'm not a very good hand at convertin' people; but I s'pose
I ought ter tackle Cooley too. He's bin a-carryin' on scand'lus
lately, so I hear."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I hadn't heard of it."</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus267.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Yes, sir; comin' home o' nights with a load on, an'
a-snortin' at that poor little wife of his'n. By gracious, it's
rough, isn't it? An' Mrs. Cooley was tellin' my old woman
that some of them fellers rubbed Cooley's nose the other
night with phos<i>phor</i>ous while he was asleep
down at the tavern; an' when he went home,
it 'peared 's if he had a locomotive headlight
in front of him."</p>

<p>"A very extraordinary proceeding, judge."</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus268a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Well, sir, when he got in the hall it was
dark, an' he ketched a sight o' that nose in the lookin'-glass
<a class="pagenum" id="page_266">[Pg 266]</a>
on the hat-rack, an' he thought Mrs. Cooley had left the gas burnin'. Then
he tried to turn it off, an' after fumblin' around among the umbrellers an' hat-pegs
for a while for the stop-cock, he concluded the light must come from a candle,
an' he nearly bu'sted his lungs tryin' to blow it out. Then he grabbed his hat an'
tried to jam her down over that candle; an' when he found he couldn't, he got
mad, picked up an umbreller an' hit a whack at it, which broke the lookin'-glass
all to flinders; an' there was Mrs. Cooley a-watchin' that old
lunatick all the time, an' afraid to tell him it was his own
nose.  I tell you, Adeler, this yer rum drinkin' 's a fearful thing any way you
take it, now, ain't it?"</p>

</div>

<p>I am glad to say that the <i>Argus</i> has been fully repaid for its attempts to
beguile the judge into the use of bitters. The <i>Argus</i> is in complete disgrace with
all the people who attend our church. Some of the
admirers of Rev. Dr. Hopkins, the clergyman, gave
<a class="pagenum" id="page_267">[Pg 267]</a>
him a gold-headed cane a few days ago, and a reporter of
the <i>Argus</i> was invited to be present. Nobody knows
whether the reporter was temporarily insane, or whether
the foreman, in giving out the "copy," mixed it accidentally
with an account of a patent hog-killing machine which was
tried in Wilmington on that same day, but the appalling
result was that the <i>Argus</i> next morning contained this somewhat
obscure but very dreadful narrative:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figright w50">
<img src="images/illus269.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Several of Rev. Dr. Hopkins's friends called upon him
yesterday, and after a brief conversation the unsuspicious
hog was seized by the hind legs and slid along a beam until
he reached the hot-water tank. His friends explained the
object of their visit, and presented him with a very handsome
gold-headed butcher, who grabbed him by the tail,
swung him around, slit his throat from ear to ear, and
in less than a minute the carcass was in the water.
Thereupon he came forward and said that there were
times when the feelings overpowered one, and for
that reason he would not attempt to do more than
thank those around him, for the manner in which
such a huge animal was cut into fragments was
simply astonishing. The doctor concluded his remarks,
when the machine seized him, and in less time than it takes to write it the
hog was cut into fragments and worked up into delicious
sausage. The occasion will long be remembered by the doctor's
friends as one of the most delightful of their lives. The
best pieces can be procured for fifteen cents a pound; and we
are sure that those who have sat so long under his ministry
will rejoice that he has been treated so handsomely."</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_268">[Pg 268]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Argus</i> lost at least sixty subscribers in consequence
of this misfortune, and on the following Sunday we had a
very able and very energetic sermon from Dr. Hopkins upon
"The Evil Influence of a Debauched Public Press." It
would have made Colonel Bangs shiver to have heard that
discourse. Lieutenant Smiley came home with us after
church, and I am sorry to say he exulted over the sturdy
blows given to the colonel.</p>

<p>"I haven't any particular grudge against the man," he
said, "but I don't think he has treated me exactly fair. I
sent him an article last Tuesday, and he actually had the insolence
to return me the manuscript without offering a word
of explanation."</p>

<p>"To what did the article refer?"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus270.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Why, it gave an account of a very singular thing that
happened to a friend of mine, the son of old Commodore
Watson. Once, when the commodore was about to go upon
a voyage, he had a presentiment that something would occur
<a class="pagenum" id="page_269">[Pg 269]</a>
to him, and he made a will leaving his son Archibald all
his property on condition that, in case of his death, Archibald
would visit his tomb and pray at it once every year.
Archibald made a solemn vow that he would, and the commodore
started upon his journey. Well, sir, the fleet went
to the Fiji Islands, and while there the old man came ashore
one day, and was captured by the natives. They stripped
him, laid him upon a gridiron, cooked him and ate him."</p>

<p>"That placed Archibald in a somewhat peculiar position?"</p>

<div class="figright w50">
<img src="images/illus271.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Imagine his feelings when he heard the news! How
could he perform his vow? How could he pray at the commodore's
tomb? Would not the tomb, as it were, be very
apt to prey upon him, to snatch him up and assimilate him?
There seemed to be an imminent probability that it would.
But he went. That noble-hearted young man went out
to the islands in search of the savage that ate the commodore,
and I have no doubt that he suffered upon the same
gridiron."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that Bangs declined to publish
that narrative?"</p>

<p>"He did, and he offered no explanation of his refusal."</p>

<p>"He is certainly a very incompetent person to conduct
a newspaper. A man who would refuse to give such
<a class="pagenum" id="page_270">[Pg 270]</a>
a story to a world which aches for amusement iswspaper long before
I met the lieutenant, and I am sure he borrowed it fr worse than
a blockhead."</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus272a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"By the way," said the lieutenant, changing the subject
suddenly, "I hear Parker has taken a class in the Sunday-school.
He is sly&mdash;monstrous sly, sir. Miss Magruder
teaches there, too. Parker seems to be determined to have
her, and I hope he may be successful, but I don't think he will
be, I'm sorry to say."</p>

<p>It was evident that Smiley had not heard the news, and I
did not enlighten him.</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus272b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Some men have a fitness for that kind of work, and some
haven't. There was poor Bergner, a friend of mine. He took
a class in a Sunday-school at Carlisle while we were stationed
there. The first Sunday he told the scholars a story about a boy named Simms.
Simms, he said, had climbed a tree for the purpose of stealing apples, and he fell and
killed himself. 'This,' said Bergner, 'conveys an impressive warning to the young. It
teaches an instructive lesson which I hope
will be heeded by all you boys. Bear in
mind that if Simms had not gone into that
tree he would probably now be alive and
well, and he might have grown up to be a
useful member of society. Remember this,
boys,' said Bergner, 'and resolve firmly now
that when you wish to steal apples you will do
so in the only safe way, which is to stand on
the ground and knock them down with a pole.'
A healthy moral lesson, wasn't it? Somebody told the superintendent
<a class="pagenum" id="page_271">[Pg 271]</a>
about it, and they asked Bergner to resign.
Yes, a man has to have a peculiar turn for that kind of
thing to succeed in teaching Sunday-school. I
don't know how Parker will make out."</p>

<p>Then the lieutenant shook hands and left in
order to catch the last boat for the fort.</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus273.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Mrs. Adeler," I said, as I lighted a fresh
cigar, "we may regard it as a particularly fortunate
thing that Smiley is not entrusted with the religious
education of any number of American youth. Place the
Sunday-schools of this land in the hands of Smiley and
others like him, and in the next generation the country
would be overrun with a race of liars."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am not aware that Bob Parker has ever made any very
serious attempt to write poetry for the public. Of course
since he has been in love with the bewildering Magruder he
has sometimes expressed his feelings in verse. But fortunately
these breathings of passion were not presented to a cold
and heartless world; they were reserved for the sympathetic
Magruder, who doubtless read them with delight and admiration,
and locked them up in her writing-desk with Bob's letters
and other precious souvenirs. This, of course, is all right.
Every lover writes what he considers poetry, and society
permits such manifestations without insisting upon the confinement
of the offenders in lunatic asylums. Bob, however,
has constructed some verses which are not of a sentimental
kind. Judge Pitman's story of the illumination of Cooley's
nose suggested the idea which Bob has worked into rhyme
and published in the <i>Argus</i>. As the poet has not been permitted
to shine to any great extent in these pages as a
literary person, it will perhaps be fair to reproduce his
poem in the chapter which contains the account of Cooley's
misfortune. Here it is:</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine anything
more dismal than a
rainy day at New Castle,
particularly at this late
period in the year. The
river especially is robbed of
much of its attractiveness.
The falling drops obscure the
view, so that the other shore
is not visible through the
gray curtain of mist, and
the few vessels that can be
seen out in the channel
struggling upward with the
tide or beating slowly downward
to the bay look so
drenched and cold and utterly forlorn that one shivers as he
watches them, with their black sails and their dripping cordage,
and sees the moist sailors in tarpaulins and sea-boots hurrying
over the slippery decks. The grain schooner lying at
the wharf has all her hatches down, and there is about her
no other sign of life than one soaked vagabond, who sits
<a class="pagenum" id="page_279">[Pg 279]</a>
upon the bowsprit angling in a most melancholy fashion for
fish which will not bite. He may be seeking for his supper,
poor, damp sinner! or he may be an infatuated being who
deceives himself with the notion that he is having sport.
There is a peculiar feeling of comfort on such a day to
stand in a room where a bright fire blazes in the grate, and
from the window to watch this solitary fisherman as the fitful
gusts now and then blow
the rain down upon his head in
sheets, and to observe the few
people who remain upon the
streets hurrying by under their
umbrellas, each anxious to reach
a place of shelter. The water
pours in yellow torrents through
the gutter-ways, the carriages
which go swiftly past have their
leathern aprons drawn high up in
front of the drivers, the stripped
branches of the trees are black
with moisture, and from each
twig the drops trickle to the earth; the water-spout upon the
side of the house continues its monotonous song all day long,
drip, drip, drip, until the very sound contributes to the gloominess
of the time; there is desolation in the yard and in the
garden, where a few yellow corn-stalks and headless trunks
of cabbage remain from the summer's harvest to face the
wintry storms, and where the chickens gathered
under the woodshed are standing with
ruffled feathers, hungry, damp and miserable,
some on one leg and some on two, and with an
expression upon their faces that tells plainly
the story of their dejection at the poor prospect of having
any dinner.</p>

<p>It is a good time, Mrs. Adeler, to offer a few remarks
upon that subject of perennial interest, the weather, and
especially to refer to some facts in reference to that useful
but uncertain implement, the umbrella. I do not know why
it is so, but by common agreement the umbrella has been
permitted to assume a comic aspect. No man, particularly
no journalist, can be considered as having wholly discharged
his duty to his fellow-creatures unless he has permitted himself
to make some jocular remarks concerning the exception
of umbrellas from the laws which govern other kinds of
property. The amount of facetiousness that has attended
the presentation of that theory is already incalculably great,
and there is no reason for believing that it will not be increased
to an infinite extent throughout the coming ages.
It is perhaps a feeble idea upon which to erect so vast a
structure; but if it makes even a dismal sort of merriment,
we should not complain. And then reflect with
what humorous effect the comic artists introduce
the excessive and corpulent umbrella to
their pictures of nervous or emphatic old ladies,
and how much more convulsive the laughter becomes
at the theatre when the low-comedy man
carries with him an umbrella of that unwieldy
description! It is universally admitted that an
umbrella with distended sides is funny; and if
general consent is given to such a proposition,
the consequences are quite as satisfactory as if
the article in question was really plethoric with
humor.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus283a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>There are occasions when the simple elevation
of an umbrella is grotesquely absurd, as when a
group of British guardsmen sheltered themselves
in this fashion from the rain during a certain
battle, to the infinite disgust of Wellington, who ordered the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_281">[Pg 281]</a>
tender warriors to put their umbrellas down lest the service
should be made ridiculous. It was a Frenchman,
&Eacute;mile Girardin, I think, who brought an umbrella with him
to the dueling-ground, and insisted upon holding it over his
head during the combat. "I do not mind being killed," he
said, "but I object decidedly to getting wet." They gave
him much credit for admirable coolness; but I cherish a
private opinion that he was scared, and hoped, by making the
affair ridiculous, to bring it to a conclusion without burning
powder; and he succeeded, for the combatants shook hands
and went away friends.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus283b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>And there was the case of Colonel Coombs&mdash;Coombs of
Colorado. He had heard that the most ferocious wild beast
could be frightened and put to flight if an umbrella should
suddenly be opened in its face, and he determined to test
the matter at the earliest opportunity. One day, while
walking in the woods, Coombs perceived a panther crouching,
preparatory to making a spring at him. Coombs held
his umbrella firmly in his hand, and presenting it at the
panther, unfurled it. The result was not wholly satisfactory,
for the next moment the animal leaped upon the umbrella,
flattened it out and began to lunch upon Coombs. Not only did
the beast eat that anxious inquirer after truth, but it swallowed
<a class="pagenum" id="page_282">[Pg 282]</a>
the hooked handle of the umbrella, which was held tightly
in Coombs's grasp, and for two or three weeks it wandered
about with its nose buried among the ribs of
the umbrella. It was very handy when there
was rain, but it obstructed the animal's vision,
and consequently it walked into town and was
killed.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus284a.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>In some countries the umbrella is the symbol of dignity
and power. One of the magnates of Siam is proud to
begin his list of titles with "Lord of Thirty-seven Umbrellas."
Conceive, if you can, the envy and hatred with
which that bloated aristocrat must be regarded by a man
who is lord of only fifteen umbrellas! Among certain
African tribes the grandeur of the individual increases with
the size, and not with the number, of the umbrellas. Did I
ever tell you the story of the African chieftain who determined
to surpass all his rivals in this respect?</p>

<div class="figright w50">
<img src="images/illus284b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>He made up his mind to procure the largest umbrella in
the world, and he induced a trader to send his order to London
for the article. Its ribs were forty feet in length, and
its handle was like a telegraph pole. When it was distended,
the effect was sublime. The machine resembled a green gingham
circus tent, and it was crowned with a ferule as large as a
barrel. When the umbrella arrived, there was great rejoicing
in the domestic circle of that dusky sovereign, and
so impatient was the owner to test its qualities that he fairly
yearned for the arrival of a rainy day. At last, one morning,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_283">[Pg 283]</a>
he awoke to find that his opportunity had come. The
rain was pouring in torrents. Exultingly he called forth his
vassals, and the work of opening the umbrella began in the
presence of an awestricken multitude. Two entire days
were consumed by the effort to elevate the monster, and at the
end of the second day, as the task was done, the storm ceased,
and there was a general clearing up. The disappointed chieftain
waited a day or two in vain for another shower, and finally, sick
at heart, he commanded the umbrella to be closed. The
work occupied precisely forty-eight hours, and just as the
catch snapped upon the handle a thunder-gust came up, and
it rained furiously all day. The frenzied monarch then consulted
with his medicine man, and was assured that there
would certainly be rain on the following Wednesday. The
king therefore ordered the gingham giant up again. While the
swarthy myrmidons were struggling with it there were at least
sixty or seventy violent showers, but just as it was fairly open
the clouds drifted away, and the sun came out with terrific force.
And it remained out. There was not a drop of rain or so much as
a fragment of cloud in the sky for two hundred and seventy-three
days, and the umbrella remained open during all the time,
while the potentate who owned it went dancing about daily
<a class="pagenum" id="page_284">[Pg 284]</a>
in an ecstasy of rage. At the end of the period he sought
the medicine man and slew him upon the spot. Then he
ordered the umbrella down. The very next morning after
it was closed the rain began, and it has been raining ever since.</p>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Adeler, that unfortunate savage thus became intimately
familiar with one of the most striking of meteorological
phenomena.</p>

<p>The influence of the umbrella upon the weather is a subject
that has engaged the attention of millions of mankind.
The precise laws by which that influence is exerted and
governed have not yet been defined, but the fact of the existence
of the influence is universally recognized. If there
seems to be a promise of rain in the morning when I leave
home, and I carry my umbrella with me, the sky clears before
noon; but if I neglect to take my umbrella, I will certainly
be drenched. If I carry an umbrella forty days in
order to be prepared in case of sudden showers, there will be
perfect dryness during that period; but if I forget the umbrella
on the forty-first day, the floodgates of heaven will
assuredly be opened. Sometimes the conduct of the elements
is peculiarly aggravating. When I have been caught in
town by a rain-storm and I had no umbrella, I have sometimes
darted through the shower to a store to purchase one,
but always, just as the man has given me the change, the
rain has stopped. And when I have kept one umbrella at
the house and another at the office, in order to be prepared
at both ends of the line, all the storms have begun and expended
their fury while I was passing between the two points.</p>

<p>This experience is not peculiar. It is that of every man
who uses an umbrella. I am persuaded, Mrs. Adeler, that
the time will come when science, having detected the character
of the mysterious sympathy existing between umbrellas
and the weather, will be able to give to a suffering
<a class="pagenum" id="page_285">[Pg 285]</a>
world sunshine or rain as we want it. Whether we shall
then be any better off is another matter.</p>

<p>In the mean time, while we are waiting for science to penetrate
the hidden secrets of the umbrella, let me unfold to
you a plan which I have devised for the better management
of the weather bureau at Washington. I confided the
scheme, once upon a time, to Old Probabilities himself,
through the medium of a newspaper at the capital, but he
did not deign to express an opinion concerning it. Perhaps
it contained too much levity to entitle it to the consideration
of a man who meditates upon the thunder and tries to trace
the pathway of the cyclone. I have called it</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Improved Weather System</span>.</h2>

<p>The Probability man who meddles with our great American
weather means well, and tries conscientiously to do his
best, but his system is radically defective, and the consequence
is that his conjectures are despicably incorrect quite
half the time. The inconvenience caused by these mistakes,
not only to the people generally, but to me personally, is inconceivably
great, and it is not to be endured any longer.</p>

<p>For instance, if I read in the morning that this Probability
person entertains a conviction that we shall have a clear day
in my neighborhood, I place confidence in his assurance. I
remove the roof from my house in order to dry the garret
thoroughly, and I walk down town with a new umbrella
under my arm. Now, it is plainly evident that if, after all,
it does begin to rain, and I am obliged to unfurl that umbrella
and ruin it with the wet, and I am compelled, when I
arrive at home, to witness my family floating around in the
dining-room upon a raft constructed out of the clothes-horse
and a few bed-slats and pie-boards, the government for which
Washington died is a failure.</p>

<p>Or suppose that our friend at the weather office asserts
<a class="pagenum" id="page_286">[Pg 286]</a>
that a thunder-storm is certain to strike my section of the
country upon a given day. I believe him. I bring out my
lightning-rods and buckle them to the chimneys and set them
around on the roof and plant them out in the yard and rivet
them upon my hired girl; and I place my family safely in
feather beds in the middle of the room, and drink all the
milk in the neighborhood, and prevail upon the tax collector
to go and stand an hour or two under a tree where he will
be almost certain to be struck by lightning. And when all
these arrangements are completed, so that I feel equal to the
promised emergency, suppose that thunder-storm does not
come? When I watch that tax collector sally out and begin
to assess my property, counting in all those lightning-rods at
double their cost, is there any reason to wonder that I sit
down and sigh for some responsible despot who will give us
a Probability man who grasps the subject of the weather, as
it were, in a more comprehensive manner?</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus288.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>But I lost all faith in him after his ill-treatment of Cooley.
He said that a cyclone would sweep over this district upon
a certain morning, and Cooley was so much alarmed at the
prospect that he made elaborate preparations to receive the storm.
He arose before daybreak and went into the middle of his garden,
where he filled his pockets with pig lead, fettered himself to
the apple tree and fixed the preserving kettle securely upon his
head with a dog chain in order to preserve his hair. Cooley
stayed there until five o'clock in the afternoon waiting for the
simoom to swoop down upon him.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_287">[Pg 287]</a>
But it was a failure&mdash;a disgraceful failure. And when
Cooley looked out from under the kettle in the afternoon, he
was surprised to observe that the fence was filled with men
and boys who were watching him with intense interest.
Then the boys began to whistle upon their fingers and to
make unpleasant remarks, and finally Cooley was obliged to
cut loose and go into the house to avoid arrest by a policeman
upon a charge of lunacy.</p>

<p>Now, this is all wrong. The feelings of American citizens
ought not to be trifled with in such a manner, and I propose
to arrange a plan by which meteorological facts and conditions
can be observed with something like certainty.</p>

<p>The basis of my system is Corns. The marvelous accuracy
with which changes in the weather can be foretold by
a man whose feet are decorated with those excrescences is so
well known that it is hardly worth while to consider at
length, at this particular crisis, the human corn in its
meteorological characteristics. It is quite certain, however,
that it will be impossible to expect the Probability being to
walk around the country once or twice every day for the
purpose of submitting his corns to the diverse atmospheric
influences which exist between the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans. It would wear out any man. It will be better,
therefore, to have him kept stationary. I propose, in that
event, that he should buy up any available corn that is in
the market in any given State, and have it transplanted and
grafted upon his own toe. Doubtless there are patriotic
citizens in every portion of the land who would be willing to
lay upon the altar of their beloved country their most cherished
corns.</p>

<p>The Probability official then might obtain, let us assume,
one corn from each State and a reliable bunion to represent
each Territory. When these were engrafted upon his feet in
a healthful condition, each one would, as a matter of course,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_288">[Pg 288]</a>
be peculiarly susceptible to the atmospheric influences which
prevail in its native clime. All we have to do, then, is to
compel the weather man to wear exceptionally tight boots
while he is not attending to business, so that his barometers
will acquire the requisite amount of sensibility. Then I
should have pipes laid from each State to the office in Washington
for the purpose of conveying the different varieties of
atmosphere to the foot of the Probability person. Suppose,
then, he desired to make a guess in regard to the weather in
Louisiana. I should have a man stationed at the end of the
pipe in New Orleans with a steam fan, and he could waft
zephyrs, as it were, upon the Louisiana corn, which would
respond instantly, and we should have the facts about the
weather in that State with precision and accuracy. When
we admitted a new State, our friend could weld on a new
corn; or if the Mormons succeeded in procuring the admission
of their Territory as a State, we could plough up the
Utah bunion and plant a corn, so as to preserve the proprieties.</p>

<p>Of course this system of excrescences would be of no value
as an indicator of the movements of thunder-storms and hurricanes.
But in order to acquire information concerning the
former, how would it do to build up stacks of lightning-rods
in every portion of every State, and to connect each State
group, if I may be allowed the expression, with a wire which
shall be permanently fastened to the arm or leg of the Probability
man in Washington? Because, in such a case, whenever
a thunder-gust appeared in any portion of the country,
some one out of all those bunches of lightning-rods would
certainly be struck, and our conjectural friend at the
weather office would be likely to know about it right
soon.</p>

<p>As for hurricanes, I am in favor of putting an end to
them at once, instead of telegraphing around the country to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_289">[Pg 289]</a>
warn people to look out for them. When I reorganize the
weather service, I shall have men stationed everywhere with
machines fixed up like the wind sails that are used on shipboard
for sending air into the hold. I should make the
mouth of each one a mile wide, construct it of stout canvas,
and run the lower end into a coal-mine, or a mammoth cave,
or a volcano. Then, when a tornado approached, I should
place a man at each side of the sail, put the men into balloons,
send them up, and spread the sail directly across the
route of the approaching cyclone. When it arrived, it would
strike the sail, of course; there would be a momentary flapping
and jerking around, and in a minute or two I should
have that hurricane comfortably packed away in the volcano,
suppose we say. A man would then be upon the spot,
of course, to drive a plug into the crater, so as to make
everything tight and snug, and one more nuisance is taken
off the face of the earth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Is that the whole of the article?" inquired Mrs. Adeler.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is all of it."</p>

<p>"Well, I am not surprised that no notice was taken of it.
It is perfectly nonsensical."</p>

<p>"I admit the fact, but still I shall not smother the article.
It will not do to take all the nonsense out of the world.
While thousands of learned fools are hard at work trying to
stupefy mankind, we must be permitted sometimes to indulge
in absurdities of a less weighty kind in order to counteract
them."</p>

<p>And while we are discussing the weather, let me not forget
to allude to the most remarkable of Judge Pitman's peculiarities.
He is the only man in the world of whom I know
anything who is always satisfied with the weather. No matter
what the condition of the atmosphere, he is contented
and happy, and willing to affirm that the state of things at
<a class="pagenum" id="page_290">[Pg 290]</a>
any given moment is the very best that could have been
devised.</p>

<p>In summer, when the mercury bolted up among the nineties,
the judge would come to the front door with beads of
perspiration standing out all over his red face, and would
look at the sky and say, "Splendid! perfectly splendid!
Noble weather for the poor and for the ice companies and
the washerwomen! I never saw sich magnificent weather
for dryin' clothes. They don't shake up any such climate
as this in Italy. Gimme me my umbreller, Harriet, while I sit
out yer on the steps and enjoy it."</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus292.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>In winter, when the mercury would creep down fifteen degrees
below zero, and the cold was nearly severe enough to freeze
the inside of Vesuvius solid to the centre of the globe, Pitman
would sit out on my fence and exclaim, "By gracious,
Adeler! did you ever see sich weather as this? I like an
atmosphere that freezes up yer very marrer. It helps the
coal trade an' gives us good skeetin'. Don't talk of summer-time
to me. Gimme cold, and give it to me stiff."</p>

<p>When there was a drought, Pitman used to meet me in
the street and remark, "No rain yet, I see! Magnificent,
isn't it? I want my weather dry, I want it with the dampness
left out. Moisture breeds fevers and ague, an' ruins
yer boots. If there's anything I despise, it's to carry an umbreller.
No rain for me, if you please."</p>

<p>When it rained for a week and flooded the country, the
judge often dropped in to see me and to observe, "I dunno
how you feel about this yer rain, Adeler, but it allers seems
to me that the heavens never drop no blessin's but when we
<a class="pagenum" id="page_291">[Pg 291]</a>
have a long wet spell. It makes the corn jump an' cleans
the sewers an' keeps the springs from gittin' too dry. I
wouldn't give a cent to live in a climate where there was no
rain. Put me on the Nile, an' I'd die in a week. Soak me
through an' through to the inside of my bones, and I feel
as if life was bright and beautiful, an' sorrer of no
account."</p>

<p>On a showery day, when the sun shone brightly at one
moment and at the next the rain poured in torrents, the
judge has been known to stand at the window and exclaim,
"Harriet, if you'd've asked me how I liked the weather, I'd'
ve said, just as it is now. What I want is weather that is
streaked like a piece of fat an' lean bacon&mdash;a little shine an'
a little rain. Mix 'em up an' give us plenty of both, an'
I'm yer man."</p>

<p>The judge is always happy in a thunder-storm, and one
day, after the lightning had knocked down two of his best
apple trees and splintered them into fragments, and the wind
had torn his chimney to pieces, I went over to see him. He was
standing by the prostrate trees, and he at once remarked, "Did
you ever know of a man havin' sich luck as this? I was goin'
to chop down them two trees to-morrer, an' as that chimney
never draw'd well, I had concluded to have it rebuilt. An'
that gorgeous old storm has fixed things just the way I want 'em.
Put me in a thunder-storm an'
let the lightnin' play around me, an' I'm at home. I'd
rather have one storm that'd tear the bowels out of the
American continent than a dozen of yer little dribblin'
<a class="pagenum" id="page_292">[Pg 292]</a>
waterin'-pot showers. If I can't have a rippin' and roarin'
storm, I don't want none."</p>

<p>They say here in the village, but I do not believe it, that
one day the judge was upon his roof fixing a shingle, when a
tornado struck him, lifted him off, carried him a quarter of
a mile, and dashed him with such terrible force against a
fence that his leg was broken. As they carried him home,
he opened his eyes languidly and said, "Immortal Moses!
what a storm that was! When it does blow, it suits me if
it blows hard. I'd give both legs if we could have a squall
like that every day. I&mdash;I&mdash;" Then he fainted.</p>

<p>If contentment is happiness, then the life of Pitman is one
uninterrupted condition of bliss.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">

</div>

<p>We had been talking of asking
the Magruders to come to
take tea with us, so that the
two families, which were now
to be brought into close relations,
might become better
acquainted. But one evening,
just as I had settled
myself for a comfortable
perusal of the paper, Miss
Magruder was ushered into
the room by the servant. It
was plainly evident from her
appearance that she was in
distress from some cause.
We should have guessed from her visit at such an hour unaccompanied
by any one that all was not right, even if her
countenance had not manifested extreme agitation. After
the usual salutation she asked,</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Parker not at home?"</p>

<p>"He has not yet returned from the city," I said. "I suppose
he has been detained for some reason. It is probable
that he will be here presently."</p>

<p>"I wanted to see him," she said, hesitatingly. "I am
afraid you'll think it very queer for me to come here at such
<a class="pagenum" id="page_294">[Pg 294]</a>
a strange time; but&mdash;but"&mdash;and here her voice quavered a
little&mdash;"but oh, something dreadful has happened&mdash;something
very, very dreadful."</p>

<p>Then the tears began to come into her pretty brown eyes,
and the little maid, after striving desperately to restrain
them and to retain her composure, buried her face in her
hands and began to sob. There was a woman by her side
in a moment to comfort her and to seek her confidence; but
it was very awkward for me. I was not quite certain
whether I ought not to fly from the room and permit the
two to be alone. But I remained with mingled feelings of
sympathy and curiosity, and with an indistinct notion that
the forlorn damsel before me regarded me as a flinty-hearted
brute because I didn't express violent indignation at her ill-treatment.
I should have done so if I had had any conception
of the nature of the wrong endured by her. At last,
when she had obtained relief in a good cry&mdash;and it is surprising
how much better a troubled woman feels when she has
cried and wiped her weeping eyes&mdash;Bessie told us the story.</p>

<p>"Father came to me to-day," she said, "and told me that
he had heard some dreadful things about Robert; and he
said he could not consent to my marriage with such a man,
and that our engagement must be broken off."</p>

<p>"What kind of things?" indignantly demanded Mrs.
Adeler, whose family pride was aroused; "what did he
hear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, something perfectly awful!" exclaimed Bessie, looking
up with fresh tears in her eyes. "He said Robert drank
a great deal and that he was very often intoxicated."</p>

<p>"What an outrageous falsehood!" exclaimed Mrs. Adeler.</p>

<p>"I told father it was," said Bessie; "but he said he knew
it was true, and, worse than that, that Robert not only kept
very bad company in the city, but that he was an atheist&mdash;that
he only came to church in order to deceive us."</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_295">[Pg 295]</a></p>

<p>If the late Mr. Fahrenheit had had to indicate the warmth
of Mrs. Adeler's indignation at this moment, he would have
given 215&deg; as the figure. "I declare," she said, "that is the
wickedest falsehood I ever heard. I will call upon Mrs.
Magruder to-morrow morning and tell her so."</p>

<p>"And father insisted," said Bessie, "that I should write a
formal note to Robert, breaking our engagement and asking
him to discontinue his visits to our house. I did so, but I
could not bear to have him think me so heartless, and I felt
as if I must come here and tell him about it before the note
reached him. Please don't think it strange that I came,
and don't let any one know it." Then Bessie began to sob
again.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Bessie," I replied, "it was very proper for
you to do as you have done. Your father has been unjust
to you and to Bob. Robert shall see him and demand an
explanation. But who do you suppose told your father
these things?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea. But it must have been somebody who
was opposed to our marriage, and who hated Robert. I
can't believe that any one would have invented such stories
without a very malicious motive."</p>

<p>"Well, Bessie, the only thing we can do now is to permit
the matter to rest as it is until we have an opportunity to
disprove these slanders. Let me go home with you; and
when Bob comes in, I will tell him all about it. He shall
call upon your father. I will do so myself to-morrow. Bob
has been unfairly used. He is as proper a youth as any in
the land, and worthy of the love of any woman."</p>

<p>Then I escorted Bessie to her home, and upon my way
back I met Bob coming in hot haste toward me. He arrived
at the house just after our departure; and a few words from
Mrs. Adeler having placed him in command of the situation,
he started off at once with the hope to overtake us and to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_296">[Pg 296]</a>
have a few words with Bessie. He was breathless and in a
condition of frenzy. He at first insisted upon storming the
castle of the Magruders at once
for the purpose of assailing the
dragon that guarded his fair lady.
But I showed him that it would
perhaps injure Bessie if he should
excite suspicion that she had visited
him, and that it would be
ridiculous at any rate to attack
old Magruder at that time of
night and while he was in such
a state of excitement. It was
finally agreed that we should
wait until morning, and that then
I should first visit Mr. Magruder and obtain an explanation
from him, so that Bob could go there afterward fully prepared
to vindicate himself.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus298.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"I'll bet anything," said Bob, as we walked home, "I
know who is the author of these slanders. It is Cooley. He
don't like you or any of your family, and he has taken this
means of injuring us. If it is he, I'll give him an aggravated
case of assault and battery to settle. I'll thrash him
within an inch of his life."</p>

<p>"I don't believe Cooley did it," I replied. "It is not the
kind of business that he would care to trouble himself with. It
is some one who has an interest in separating you and Bessie."</p>

<p>"I don't know of any such person," said Bob.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Smiley did it."</p>
<p>
"That may be," replied Bob; "he has little enough principle,
but I hardly think he would display so much malice.
Besides, he knows very well Bessie would not accept him
under any circumstances."</p>

</div>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus299b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>"Well, let us wait patiently for further developments. It
<a class="pagenum" id="page_297">[Pg 297]</a>
is not worth while to denounce any one until we can ascertain
who the offender is."</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus299c.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illustration:" />
</div>

<p>Bob had been delayed in the city by a visit to his parents,
who were going north for a week or two, and they consigned
to his care his younger brother, who came with him to our
house to remain during the absence of his father and mother.
The boy was at the house when we reached it; and when the
time came for him to go to bed, it was arranged that he
should sleep with Bob. The consequences of this were somewhat
peculiar. The youngster, it appears, has
a habit of walking in his sleep, and he was so
afraid that he would do so on this night, in a
strange house, that Bob tied a strong piece of
twine about the lad's waist and fastened the
other end to his own body, so that he would be roused by any
attempt on the part of his brother
to prowl about the room.
It turned out, however, that Bob
was the restless one. According
to his own account, he got to
dreaming of his troubles. He
imagined that he was engaged
in a frightful combat with Mr.
Magruder, and that, at the last,
that amiable old gentleman pursued
him with a drawn dagger
with the intent to butcher him.
In his alarm Bob pushed over
to Henry's side of the bed, and
finally, as the visionary Magruder still appeared to be thirsty
for his blood, he climbed over
Henry, got upon the floor and
hid himself beneath the bed.
When the apparition of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_298">[Pg 298]</a>
sanguinary parent disappeared, Bob, still soundly asleep,
must have emerged from his hiding-place
upon the side of the bed opposite that at
which he entered it. At any rate, the cord
ran from Henry's body beneath the bed
clear around until it connected with Bob.
Early in the morning Bob moved over suddenly toward his
brother; and although he was more than half asleep, he was
amazed to see Henry drop over upon the floor. Bob instantly
jumped out after him, and as he did so, he was even
more surprised to perceive the child dart under the bed.
He followed Henry; and at the first movement in that direction,
Henry shot up off the floor, and was heard rolling swiftly
across the mattress above, only to disappear again over
the side as Bob came once more to the surface. By
this time both of them were wide awake and able to comprehend
<a class="pagenum" id="page_299">[Pg 299]</a>
the phenomenon. This is Mr. Parker's version. It
is probably exaggerated slightly. My private impression is
that Henry was pulled out upon the floor and under the bed,
and that the exercise ended immediately. Henry does not
remember the particulars with sufficient distinctness to be
considered a thoroughly reliable witness. His mind is clear
upon only one point: he is fully persuaded that he
will not sleep in harness with Bob again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon the day following Bessie's visit I called at
Magruder's, in accordance with my agreement with Bob.
The servant said Mr. Magruder had gone out, but that he
would probably be home in a few moments. I declined an
invitation to go in the house. It was a fine day, and I preferred
to walk up and down the porch while waiting. When
a considerable time had elapsed and Magruder did not come,
I threw myself upon one of the chairs on the porch and began
to read the <i>Argus</i>.</p>

<p>While I was sitting there Magruder's dog came bounding
up the yard, and when he saw me instantly manifested a desire
to investigate me. I have never liked Magruder's dog;
he is very large, and he has an extremely bad reputation.
When he approached me, he looked at me savagely, and
growled in such a manner that cold chills began to run up
and down my back. Then the dog walked up and sniffed
my legs with an earnestness of purpose that I had never
expected to see displayed by a dumb animal. During this
operation I maintained a condition of profound repose. No
<a class="pagenum" id="page_300">[Pg 300]</a>
man will ever know how quiet I was. It is doubtful if any
human being ever before became so thoroughly still until
his immortal soul went to the land of everlasting rest.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus302.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>When the ceremony was ended, the dog lay down close to
the chair. As soon as I felt certain that the animal was
asleep, I thought I would go home without seeing Mr. Magruder;
but when I attempted to rise, the dog leaped up and
growled so fiercely that I sat down again at once. Then I
thought perhaps it would be better <i>not</i> to go home. It occurred
to me, however, that it would be as well to call some
one to remove the dog, in case circumstances should make it
desirable for me to depart. But at the very first shout the
animal jumped to his feet, gave a fiendish bark and began
to take a few more inquisitorial smells at my legs. And
whenever I shuffled my feet, or attempted to turn the <i>Argus</i>
over in order to continue an article on to the following page,
or made the slightest movement, that infamous dog was up and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_301">[Pg 301]</a>
at me. Once, when I was positively
compelled to sneeze, I thought,
from the indignation boisterously
manifested by the dog, that
my hour at last had come.</p>

<div class="figright w25">

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus303b.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>Finally, Cooley's dog, which
happened to be in the neighborhood,
became engaged in an
angry controversy with another
dog in the street in front of me.
Magruder's dog was wide awake in a moment; and after
turning a regretful glance at me, as if he knew he was deliberately
and foolishly throwing away a chance
of obtaining several glorious bites, he dashed
down the walk and over the fence for the
purpose of participating in the discussion between
his two friends.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus303c.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>I did not actually run, because that would not have been
dignified, and the servant-girl, looking from the kitchen
window, and not understanding the nature of the emergency,
might have suspected me of
emotional insanity. But I walked
rapidly&mdash;very rapidly&mdash;to the
rear fence of the yard, and climbed
over it. As I reached the
top of the fence, I saw the dog
coming at full gallop down the
yard. He was probably chagrined,
but I did not remain to
see how he bore it. I went directly
home. Mr. Parker may
manage his own love affairs in
the future. I shall not approach
Mr. Magruder upon this disagreeable
<a class="pagenum" id="page_302">[Pg 302]</a>
subject again. I have enough to do to attend to my
own business.</p>

<p>When I reached home, I found Judge Pitman
waiting for me. He came in for the purpose of
borrowing my axe for a few moments. As we
went around to the rear of the house to get it,
the judge said:</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus304a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"I reckon you don't use no terbacker, do you?"</p>

<p>"I smoke sometimes; that is all."</p>

<p>"Well, I was jist feelin' 's if I wanted a chaw, an' I
thought p'rhaps you might have one about you. Seein'
Cooley over there on his porch put me in mind of it."</p>

<p>"That is rather a singular circumstance. Why should a
view of Cooley suggest such a thing?"</p>

<div class="figright w50">
<img src="images/illus304b.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"'Tis kinder sing'lar; but you see," said the judge, "Cooley
was a-tellin' me yesterday mornin' about somethin' that occurred
the day before at his house. The old woman is opposed
to his chawin', an' she makes it stormy for him when
he does. So he never uses no terbacker 'round home, an'
he told her he'd given it up. The other day, just as he was
goin' in to supper, he pulled out his handkercher, an' out
come a plug of terbacker 'long with it. He didn't
know it, but directly Mrs. Cooley lit on it, an' she
walked up to him an' wanted to know if it was his. It
was a little rough, you understand, but he had presence
of mind enough to turn to his boy and say, 'Great
<a class="pagenum" id="page_303">[Pg 303]</a>
Heavens! is it possible you've begun to chaw this ornary
stuff? What d'you mean by sich conduct?
Haven't I told you often enough to let terbacker
alone? Commere to me this minute,
you rascal!' Cooley licked him like the nation,
an' then threw the terbacker out the winder
onto the porch, where he could git it agin in the mornin'."</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus305.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"That was pretty severe treatment of the boy."</p>

<p>"An' Cooley says to me, 'By gracious, judge! s'pose'n my
children had all been girls! It makes an old father's heart
glad when he thinks he has a boy he can depend upon at
sich times!' Healthy old parent, ain't he?"</p>

<p>"The word 'healthy' hardly expresses with sufficient vigor
the infamy of his conduct."</p>

<p>"Cooley never did treat that there boy right," said the
judge, as he seated himself on the saw-horse in the woodshed
and locked his hands over one of his knees, evidently with
the intention to have some sociable conversation. "He
never behaved like a father to him. He brought up that
there child to lie. That echo business, f'r instance; it was
scand'lus in him."</p>

<p>"To what do you refer?"</p>

<p>"Why, afore Cooley come yer to live he kep' a hotel up
in the Lehigh Valley&mdash;a fashionable kinder tavern, I reckon;
an' there was another man about two miles furder up who
had a bigger hotel. You could stand on this other man's
porch an' make a splendid echo by whistlin' or hollerin'.
You could hear the noise agin a dozen times. Leastways,
Cooley told me so. Well, Cooley, you know, hated like pisin
to be beaten on that echo, an' so he kinder concluded to git
one up for himself. He made that there boy of his'n go
over on the mountain across the river an' hide among the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_304">[Pg 304]</a>
bushes, an' then he would take people up on the roof of the
house and holler, an' the boy would holler back agin. He
told everybody that the echo could only be heard on the roof,
an' he kep' the trap door locked, so's nobody would find him out."</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus306a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"That was a poor kind of a swindle."</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus306b.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"Yes, sir. Well, that boy, you 'bserve, gradually got rusty in
the business an' tired of it, an' sometimes he'd take another boy
over with him, an' they'd git to playin' an' forgit to answer. It
was embarrassin' for Cooley, an'
the secret begun to leak out. But one day the whole concern
was bu'sted. Cooley took a lot of folks from the city, among
'em some o' them newspaper people, an' for a while the boy
worked all right, But he had another feller with him, and
he kep' a-repeatin' things that nobody
said. Cooley stood it for a while, though he was mad as
fury; an' at last, when somebody tried to start the echo, there was
no answer. They all thought it was mighty queer, but after callin'
a good many times, the boy come out in full view an' yelled back,
'I'm not a-goin' to answer any more. Bill Johnson won't gimme
my knife, an' I won't holler till I git it; blamed if I do.' Cooley
tells me that the manner in which he sailed across the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_305">[Pg 305]</a>
creek after that child was somethin' awful to behold. But
it knocked him, sir. It closed him up. Them newspaper
men started the thing on him, an' they run him so hard
that he had to quit. He sold out and come yer to live. But
is it any wonder that boy's spiled? Cooley'd spile a blessed
young angel the way he goes on. But I must say good-mornin'.
Much obleeged for the axe. Good-bye."</p>

<p>And the judge went home meditating upon Cooley's unfitness
for the duties of a parent. I would like to know if that
echo story is true. I have no doubt the judge received it
from Cooley, but it sounds as if the latter ingenious gentleman
might have wrenched it from his imagination.</p>

Persecution&mdash;A Warning to Men with Baldheaded

<div class="figleft w25">

</div>

<p>I have been the victim of a
somewhat singular persecution
for several weeks past.
When we came here to live,
Judge Pitman was partially
bald. Somebody induced
him to apply to his head a
hair restorative made by a
Chicago man named Pulsifer.
After using this liquid for a
few months, the judge was
gratified to find that his hair
had returned; and as he naturally
regarded the remedy
with admiration, he concluded
that it would be simply fair to give expression to his
feelings in some form. As I happened to be familiar with
all the facts of the case, the judge induced me to draw up a
certificate affirming them over my signature. This he
mailed to Pulsifer. I have not yet ceased to regret the
weakness which permitted me to stand sponsor for Judge
Pitman's hair. Of course, Pulsifer immediately inserted the
certificate, with my name and residence attached to it, in
half the papers in the country, as a displayed advertisement,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_307">[Pg 307]</a>
beginning with the words, "<span class="smcap">Hope for the Baldheaded;
The Most Remarkable Cure on Record</span>," in the largest
capital letters.</p>

<p>I have had faith in advertising since that time. And
Pulsifer had confidence in it too, for he wrote to me to know
what I would take to get him up a series of similar certificates
of cures performed by his other patent medicines. He
had a corn-salve which dragged a little in its sales, and he
was prepared to offer me a commission if I would write him
a strong letter to the effect that six or eight frightful corns
had been eradicated from my feet with his admirable preparation.
He was in a position, also, to do something handsome
if I could describe a few miraculous cures that had
been effected by his Rheumatic Lotion, or if I would name
certain ruined stomachs which had, as it were, been born
again through the influence of Pulsifer's Herb Bitters; and
from the manner in which he wrote, I think he would have
taken me into partnership if I had consented to write an
assurance that his Ready Relief had healed a bad leg of
eighteen years' standing, and that I could never feel that
my duty was honorably performed until he sent me a dozen
bottles more for distribution among my friends whose legs
were in that defective and tiresome condition. I was obliged
to decline Pulsifer's generous offer.</p>

<p>I heard with singular promptness from other medical
men. Fillemup &amp; Killem forwarded some of their Hair
Tonic, with a request for me to try it on any bald heads I
happened to encounter, and report. Doser &amp; Co. sent on
two packages of their Capillary Pills, with a suggestion to
the effect that if Pitman lost his hair again he would get it
back finally by following the enclosed directions. I also
heard from Brown &amp; Bromley, the agents for Johnson's
Scalp Awakener. They sent me twelve bottles for distribution
among my bald friends; then Smith &amp; Smithson wrote
<a class="pagenum" id="page_308">[Pg 308]</a>
to say that a cask of their Vesuvian Wash for the hair
would be delivered in my cellar by the express company; and
a man called on me from Jones, Butler &amp; Co. with a proposition
to pump out my vinegar barrel, and fill it with Balm
of Peru for the gratuitous use of the afflicted in the vicinity.</p>

<p>But this persecution was simply unalloyed felicity when
compared with the suffering that came in other forms. I
will not attempt to give the number
of the letters I received. I cherish
a conviction that the mail received
at our post-office doubled
the first week after Judge Pitman's
cure was announced to a
hairless world. I think every
bald-headed man in the Tropic
of Cancer must have written to
me at least twice upon the subject
of Pulsifer's Renovator and
Pitman's hair. Persons dropped
me a line to inquire if Pitman's
baldness was hereditary; and if
so, if it came from his father's or his mother's side. One
man, a phrenologist, sent on a plaster head mapped out into
town-lots, with a suggestion that I should ink over the bumps
that had been barest and most fertile in the case of Pitman.
He said he had a little theory which he wanted to demonstrate.
A man in San Francisco wrote to inquire if my
Pitman was the same Pitman who came out to California in
1849 with a bald head; and if he was, would I try to collect
two dollars Pitman had borrowed from him in that year? The
superintendent of a Sunday-school in Vermont forwarded
eight pages of foolscap covered with an argument supporting
the theory that it was impious to attempt to force hair to
grow upon a head which had been made bald, because,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_309">[Pg 309]</a>
although Elisha was bald, we find no record in the Bible
that he used renovator of any kind. He warned Pitman
to beware of Absalom's fate, and to avoid riding mules out
in the woods. A woman in Snyder county, Penna., sent me
a poem inspired by the incident, and entitled "Lines on the
Return of Pitman's Hair." A party in Kansas desired to
know whether I thought Pulsifer's Renovator could be used
beneficially by a man who had been scalped. Two men in
New Jersey wrote, in a manner totally irrelevant to the
subject, to inquire if I could get each of them a good hired
girl. I received a confidential letter from a man who was
willing to let me into a "good thing" if I had
five hundred dollars cash capital. Mrs. Singerly,
of Frankford, related that she had
shaved her dog, and shaved him too close,
and she would be relieved if I would inform
her if the Renovator would make hair grow on a dog. A
devoted mother in Rhode Island said her little boy had accidentally
drank a bottle of
the stuff, and she would go
mad unless I could assure
her that there was no danger
of her child having his
stomach choked up with
hair. And over eleven
hundred boys inquired what
effect the Renovator would
have on the growth of whiskers
which betrayed an inclination
to stagnation.</p>

<p>But the visitors were a
more horrible torment. Bald
men came to see me in
droves. They persecuted
<a class="pagenum" id="page_310">[Pg 310]</a>
me at home and abroad. If I went to church, the sexton
would call me out during the prayers to see a man in the
vestibule who wished to ascertain if Pitman merely bathed
his head or rubbed the medicine in with a brush. When I
went to a party, some bald-headed miscreant would stop me
in the midst of the dance to ask if Pitman's hair began to
grow in the full of the moon or when it was new. While I
was being shaved, some one would bolt into the shop and insist,
as the barber held me by the nose, upon knowing whether
Pitman wore ventilators in his hat. If I attended a wedding,
as likely as not a bare-headed outlaw would stand by me at
the altar and ask if Pitman ever slept in nightcaps; and
more than once I was called out of bed at night by wretches
who wished to learn, before they left the town, if I thought
it hurt the hair to part it behind.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus312.jpg" width="100%" alt="Illusration" />
</div>

<p>It became unendurable. I issued orders to the servants
to admit to the house no man with a bald head. But that
very day a stranger obtained admission to the parlor; and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_311">[Pg 311]</a>
when I went down to see him, he stepped softly around,
closed all the doors mysteriously, and asked me, in a whisper,
if any one could hear us. Then he pulled off a wig; and
handing me a microscope, he requested me to examine his
scalp and tell him if there was any hope. I sent him over
to see Pitman; and I gloat over the fact that he bored Pitman

for two hours with his baldness.</p>

<p>I am sorry now that I ever wrote anything upon the subject
of his hair. A bald Pitman, I know, is less fascinating
than a Pitman with hair; but rather than have suffered
this misery, I would prefer a Pitman without an eye-winker,
or fuzz enough on him to make a camel's-hair pencil. But
I shall hardly give another certificate of cure in any event.
If I should see a patent-medicine man take a mummy which
died the year Joseph was sold into Egypt, and dose it until
it kicked off its rags and danced the polka mazourka while
it whistled the tune, I would die at the stake sooner than
acknowledge the miracle on paper. Pitman's hair winds me
up as far as medical certificates are concerned.</p>

<p>Bob has succeeded in obtaining from Mr. Magruder an explanation
of the interference of that stern parent with the
progress of his love affair, and we hope now to secure a
happy adjustment of the difficulty.</p>

<p>"When I entered the room," said Bob, "the old man
looked gloomy and stiff, as if he regarded me as a totally
depraved being, too far gone in iniquity to be worth an effort
to effect a reform. I went right at him. I told him I had
heard that some one had made certain charges against me
which were likely to hurt my reputation, and that it was because
of these that he had refused to permit me to marry
his daughter.</p>

<p>"He said I had stated the case correctly. Then I asked
him to give me the name of the person who had made these
<a class="pagenum" id="page_312">[Pg 312]</a>
accusations. He hesitated for a few moments, and I then declared
that the charges were false and slanderous, and asserted
that I had a right to know who the author of them was.</p>

<p>"After thinking over the matter for a while, he said,</p>

<p>"'Well, Mr. Parker, I believe you have that right. I
have thought lately that I did not perhaps treat you very
fairly in not bringing you face to face in the first place with
the man who accused you. But I almost pledged myself
to regard his statements as confidential; and as the evidence
seemed to be overwhelming against you, I concluded not to
offer you the opportunity. Mrs. Magruder takes a different
view of the matter. She thinks you should not be condemned
without a hearing, and she distrusts your accuser. His name
is Smiley&mdash;Lieutenant Smiley.'</p>

<p>"Then the old man went on," said Bob, "and told me that
Smiley had sought a private interview with him, at which
Smiley had declared that I was not only a debauchee, but
an atheist. He made this statement, he told Mr. Magruder,
with reluctance and regret, but he felt that as a friend of the
family he had a duty to perform which was imperative.
Smiley declared that he had frequently seen me under the
influence of liquor, and that I had often attacked him for
professing to believe in the Christian religion. A splendid
old professor of religion he is!" exclaimed Mr. Parker.
"And then," continued Bob, "Mr. Magruder said Smiley
produced two letters, one from a man named Dewey who pretended
to be the pastor of a church in Philadelphia, from
which he said I was dismissed for expressing atheistical
opinions, and the other from a certain Samuel Stonebury,
wherein Samuel gave me a dreadful character for honesty
and sobriety.</p>

<p>"Thereupon I informed Mr. Magruder that I knew of no
clergyman named Dewey, and that I didn't believe such a
man existed in Philadelphia; that I never belonged to any
<a class="pagenum" id="page_313">[Pg 313]</a>
church, and certainly was never kicked out of one because of
my atheistical opinions, for I never entertained such views.
I informed him also that Mr. Stonebury was a youth who was
once employed in our store, and who was discharged because
I discovered that he had been stealing. How Smiley found
him I can't imagine. They must have had a natural tendency
to gravitate toward each other as children of the same
old father of lies.</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Magruder said that if I could prove these facts
he would not only hand Bessie over to me again, but he
would also make me a very humble apology. I promised to
accomplish these results, and to-morrow I will set about the
work. I have no doubt at all that Stonebury wrote the letter
signed 'Dewey,' and that Smiley suggested that playful little
dodge to him. I will move on Smiley's works when I meet
him. He is the wickedest kind of a scoundrel."</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus315.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>And so the case of Parker <i>versus</i> Smiley stands at present.
I should have a higher respect for Magruder if he had acted
more justly with Bob in the first place. If Mrs. Magruder's
instinct and common sense had not induced her to regard
Smiley with suspicion, I am afraid that Bob's wrongs would
never have been righted. The
doctor is evidently the wiser and
better person of the two, and I
am not surprised now that she
keeps her husband a little in the
background.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some relatives of the Magruders
named Kemper came to the village
to live a few weeks ago, and they
rented a house not far from mine.
We have a life insurance agent in
the town named Benjamin P.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_314">[Pg 314]</a>
Gunn, and he is decidedly the most enterprising and indefatigable
of the fraternity of which he is a member. He
has already bored everybody in the county nearly to death,
and it is easy to imagine the delight he feels when a new
victim comes within his reach. The Kempers were hardly
fixed in their new home when Gunn, who had been awaiting
with impatience a chance to attack them, one morning
called for the purpose of ascertaining if he could induce
Mr. Kemper to take out a policy of insurance upon his life.
In response to his summons Mrs. Kemper came into the
parlor to see him. The following conversation then ensued:</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Gunn, "Mr. Kemper has no insurance
on his life?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Kemper.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to get him to take a policy in our company.
It's the safest in the world&mdash;the largest capital,
smallest rates and biggest dividends."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kemper don't take much interest in such things
now," said Mrs. K.</p>

<p>"Well, madam, but he ought to, in common justice to
you. No man knows when he will die; and by paying a
ridiculously small sum now, Mr. Kemper can leave his
family in affluence. I'd like to hand you, for him, a few
pamphlets containing statistics upon the subject; may I?"</p>

<p>"Of course, if you wish to."</p>

<p>"Don't you think he can be induced to insure?" asked
Gunn.</p>

<p>"I hardly think so," replied Mrs. Kemper.</p>

<p>"He is in good health, I suppose? Has he complained
lately of being sick?"</p>

<p>"Not lately."</p>

<p>"May I ask if he has any considerable wealth?"</p>

<p>"Not a cent."</p>

<p>"Then, of course, he must insure. No poor man can
<a class="pagenum" id="page_315" title="315"></a>
afford to neglect such an opportunity. I suppose he travels
sometimes&mdash;goes about in railroad cars and other dangerous
places?"</p>

<p>"No, he keeps very quiet."</p>

<p>"Man of steady habits, I s'pose?"</p>

<p>"Very steady."</p>

<p>"He is the very man I want," said Gunn. "I know I
can sell him a policy."</p>

<p>"I don't think you can," replied Mrs. Kemper.</p>

<p>"Why? When will he be home? I'll call on him. I
don't know of any reason why I shouldn't insure him."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Mrs. K.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He <i>has been dead twenty-seven years</i>!" said the widow.</p>

<div class="figright w50">
<img src="images/illus317.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>Then Mr. Gunn said
"good-morning," and returned
to his office. The
widow must have told the
story to some one, probably
to Magruder, for it was
soon known all over town,
and those who had suffered
from an excess of Gunn
gloried in his discomfiture.
As this was the first time in
his career that he had ever
been down, it is not surprising
that several of his
enemies should improve the
opportunity by giving him
a few vigorous kicks. The most venomous attack upon him,
however, appeared in the <i>Argus</i>. It came, I think, from
that remarkable medical man Dr. Tobias Jones, who dislikes
Gunn because he employs a rival physician, Dr. Brindley,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_316">[Pg 316]</a>
to examine persons who apply for policies. He called
the article</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">A Life Insurance Agent.</span></h2>

<p>His name was Benjamin P. Gunn, and he was the agent
for a life insurance company. He came around to my office
fourteen times in one morning to see if he could not persuade
me to take out a policy. He used to waylay me on the
street, at church, in my own house, and bore me about that
policy. If I went to the opera, Gunn would buy the seat
next to me, and sit there the whole evening talking about
sudden death and the advantages of the ten-year plan. If I
got into a railway car, Gunn would come rushing in and sit
by my side, and drag out a lot of mortality tables and begin
to explain how I could gouge a fortune out of his company.
If I sat down to dinner in a restaurant, up would come
Gunn; and seizing the chair next to me, he would tell a
cheering anecdote about a man who insured in his company
for $50,000 only last week, and was buried yesterday. If
I attended the funeral of a departed friend, and wept as they
threw the earth upon his coffin, I would hear a whisper; and
turning around, there would be the indomitable Benjamin
P. Gunn, bursting to say, "Poor Smith! Knew him well.
Insured for ten thousand in our company. Widow left
in comfortable circumstances. Let me take your name.
Shall I?"</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus319a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>He followed me everywhere, until at last I got so sick of
Gunn's persecutions that I left town suddenly one evening
and hid myself in a distant city, hoping to get rid of him.
At the end of two weeks I returned, reaching home at one
o'clock in the morning. I had hardly got into bed before
there was a ring at the door-bell. I looked out, and there
was Gunn with another person. Mr. Gunn observed that
he expected my return, and thought he would call around
about that insurance policy. He said he had the doctor
<a class="pagenum" id="page_317">[Pg 317]</a>
with him, and if I would come down he would take my name
and have me examined immediately. I was too indignant
to reply. I shut the window with a slam and went to bed
again. After breakfast in the morning I opened
the front door, and there was Gunn sitting on
the steps with his doctor, waiting for me. He
had been there all night. As I came out they
seized me and tried to undress me there on the
pavement in order to examine me. I retreated
and locked myself up in the garret, with orders to admit nobody
to the house until I came down stairs.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus319b.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>But Gunn wouldn't be baffled. He actually rented the
house next door and stationed himself in the garret adjoining
mine. When he got fixed, he spent his time pounding on the
partition and crying, "Hallo! I say! how about that
policy? Want to take it out now?" And then
he would tell me some more anecdotes about
men who were cut off immediately after paying
the first premium. But I paid no attention to
him and made no noise. Then he was silent for
a while.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus320a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>Suddenly the trap-door of my garret was
wrenched off; and upon looking up, I saw
Gunn, with the doctor and a crowbar and a lot
of death-rates, coming down the ladder at me.
I fled from the house to the Presbyterian church close by,
and paid the sexton twenty dollars to let me climb up to the
point of the steeple and sit astride of the ball. I promised
him twenty more if he would exclude everybody from that
steeple for a week. Once safely on the ball, three hundred
feet from the earth, I made myself comfortable with the
thought that I had Gunn at a disadvantage, and I determined
to beat him finally if I had to stay there for a month.
About an hour afterward, while I was looking at the superb
<a class="pagenum" id="page_318">[Pg 318]</a>
view to the west, I heard a rustling sound upon the other
side of the steeple. I looked around, and there was Benjamin
P. Gunn creeping up the side of the spire
in a balloon, in which was the doctor and the
tabular estimates of the losses of his company
from the Tontine system. As soon as Gunn
reached the ball he threw his grappling-iron
into the shingles of the steeple, and asked me
at what age my father died, and if any of my
aunts ever had consumption or liver complaint.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus320b.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>Without waiting to reply, I slid down the
steeple to the ground and took the first train
for the Mississippi Valley. In two weeks I
was in Mexico. I determined to go to the interior
and seek some wild spot in some elevated
region where no Gunn would ever dare
to come. I mounted a mule, and paid a guide
to lead me to the summit of Popocatapetl.
We arrived at the foot of the mountain at
noon. We toiled upward for about four
hours. Just before reaching the top I heard the sound of
voices; and upon rounding a point of rocks, whom should I see
but Benjamin P. Gunn, seated on the very edge of the crater,
explaining the endowment plan
to his guide and stupefying him
with a mortality table, while the
doctor had the other guide a few
yards off, examining him to see if
he was healthy! Mr. Gunn arose
and said he was glad to see me,
because now we could talk over
that business about the policy
without fear of interruption. In
<a class="pagenum" id="page_319">[Pg 319]</a>
a paroxysm of rage I pushed him backward into the crater,
and he fell a thousand feet below with a heavy thud.
As he struck the bottom I heard a voice screaming out
something about "non-forfeiture;" but there was a sudden
convulsion of the mountain, a cloud of smoke, and I heard
no more.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus321a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>But on the following Thursday an eruption began, and
the first thing that was thrown out was Benjamin P. Gunn,
scorched, with his hair singed
off and in a profuse perspiration,
but still active and ready for
business. If I should be killed, I
verily believe Gunn would commit
suicide in order that he might
follow me into the next world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus321b.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>Of course this is mere burlesque
and it is hardly fair treatment
of Gunn. But I am gratified to learn that such ridicule
does not hurt his feelings. On the day the article appeared
he called to see Colonel Bangs. The colonel apprehended an
assault; and rallying his clerks and reporters around him, he
seized a club and gave orders that Gunn should
be admitted. But Benjamin did not intend
war. He grasped the colonel's hand; and after
thanking him for such a handsome gratuitous
advertisement, he pulled a schedule out of his
pocket and argued with Bangs until the latter
in despair agreed to take out another policy for ten thousand
dollars in Gunn's company.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We do not regard Lieutenant Smiley as a very entertaining
person at present, and of course he is not quoted with
enthusiasm. But during the prevalence of the excitement
<a class="pagenum" id="page_320">[Pg 320]</a>
created by the victory over Pitman's baldness, Smiley related
an anecdote bearing upon the subject of hair which combined
instruction with amusement in a remarkable degree,
and it may be profitable to reproduce it here as an illustration
of the demoralizing tendencies of the red man.</p>

<p>During the recent visit of a party of Indians to the East,
one of the number, Squatting Bear, was observed to behave
himself in a very remarkable and mysterious manner. He
separated himself from his companions on one occasion for
several hours, and was then seen returning dragging a huge
Saratoga trunk behind him through the streets with a string.
When he reached his lodgings with the trunk, the other
Indians were puzzled. Some of them believed the trunk to
be a model for a new kind of wigwam with a Mansard roof,
while others conceived the idea that it was a patent bath-tub
of some peculiar sort, and that Squatting Bear, in a moment
of mental aberration, had been seized with an inexplicable
and unprecedented desire to wash himself. The souls of the
savages burned with fiery indignation as they contemplated
the possibility of the adoption of this revolutionary, enervating
and demoralizing practice of the pale faces by the
noble red man. But when they questioned Squatting Bear
and remonstrated with him, that incomprehensible brave
merely placed his copper-colored finger upon his burnt-umber
nose and winked solemnly with his right eye.</p>

<p>The trunk was carried through to the wigwam of Squatting
Bear unopened, and within the precincts of his home it
was hidden finally from view, and was soon entirely forgotten.</p>

<p>In the tribe the brave who killed the largest number of
enemies in any given year and secured the usual trophies of
victory was entitled to occupy the position as chief. Squatting
Bear was known to have ardent aspirations for the office,
and he worked hard to win it. For a while after his return
he was always foremost in every fight; and when the scalps
<a class="pagenum" id="page_321">[Pg 321]</a>
were counted around the camp-fire, he invariably had secured
the greatest number. Gradually, however, certain of the
braves were impressed with the notion that Squatting's
trophies sometimes did not bear a very correct proportion to
the ferocity of the contest or to the number of the slain.
Several times, after a brief skirmish in which ten or fifteen
men were killed, Squatting would come sidling home with as
many scalps as there were dead men; and at the same time
the other warriors would together have nearly as many more.</p>

<p>The braves thought it was queer, but they did not give the
subject very serious attention until after the massacre of a
certain band of emigrants which had passed close by the
camp of the tribe. There were just twenty persons in the
company, and after the butchery several Indians took the
trouble to count the bodies and to keep tally with a butcher-knife
upon the side of a chip. That night, when the scalps
were numbered, each brave had one or two apiece, but
Squatting Bear handed out exactly forty-seven of the most
beautiful bunches of human hair that had ever been seen west
of the Mississippi. The braves looked cross-eyed at each
other and cleared their throats. Two of their number stole
out to the battlefield for the purpose of counting the bodies
again, and of ascertaining if this had been a menagerie with
a few double-headed persons in the party.</p>

<p>Yes, there lay exactly twenty corpses, and, to make matters
worse, one of them was a bald-headed man who, for
additional security to his scalp, had run a skate-strap over
his head and buckled it under his chin.</p>

<p>When they returned, the entire camp devoted itself to
meditation and calculation.</p>

<p>Twenty men killed and forty-seven scalps in the possession
of a single Indian, without counting those secured by other
participants in the contest! The more the warriors pondered
over this fact, the more perplexing it became. A brave,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_322">[Pg 322]</a>
while eating his supper and reflecting upon the problem,
would suddenly imagine he saw his way clear, and he would
stop, with his mouth full of baked dog, and fix his eyes upon
the wall and think desperately hard. But the solution
invariably eluded him. Then all of them would glide behind
their wigwams and perform abstruse mathematical calculations
upon their fingers, and they would get sticks and jam
the points into the sand and do hard sums out of their aboriginal
arithmetic. And they would tear around through the
Indian rule of three, and struggle through their own kind
of vulgar fractions, and wrestle with something that they
believed to be a multiplication table. But in vain. Forty-seven
scalps off twenty heads! It seemed incredible and
impossible.</p>

<p>They tried it with algebra, and let the number of heads
equal <i>x</i> and the number of scalps equal <i>y</i>, and they multiplied
<i>x</i> into <i>y</i> and subtracted every letter in the alphabet in
succession from the result until their brains reeled; but still
the mystery remained unsolved.</p>

<p>At last a secret council was held, and it was determined
that Squatting Bear must have some powerful and wonderful
charm which enabled him to perform such miracles, and all
hands agreed to investigate the matter upon the first opportunity.
So the next week there was another fight, in which
four persons were killed, and that night Squatting actually
had the audacity to rush out one hundred and eighty-seven
scalps, and to ask those benighted savages, sitting around
their fire, to believe that he had snatched all that hair from
those four heads.</p>

<p>It was too much&mdash;much too much; they seized him and
drove a white oak stake through his bosom to hold him still,
and then they proceeded to his wigwam to ascertain how that
scalp business was conducted by the Bear family. They
burst open the Saratoga trunk the first thing, and there they
<a class="pagenum" id="page_323">[Pg 323]</a>
found fifteen hundred wigs and a keg of red paint, purchased
by the disgraceful aboriginal while in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>That concluded his career. They buried him at once in
the Saratoga trunk, and the wigs with him; and ever since
that time they have elected annually a committee on scalps,
whose business it is to examine every hirsute trophy with a
double-barreled microscope of nine hundred diameters.</p>

<p>While I was helping one of my
youngsters a night or two ago
to master a tough little problem
in his arithmetic, I picked
up the history that he had
been studying, and as he went
off to bed with the other tiny
travelers up the hill of knowledge,
I looked through the
volume. It was Goodrich's
History of the United States,
for the use of beginners; and
it had a very familiar appearance.
I gained my first
glimpse of the past from this
very book; and not only could I remember the text as I
turned over the leaves, but the absurd pictures of General
Washington and the surrender of Cornwallis, the impossible
portraits of John Smith and Benjamin Franklin, and
the unnatural illustration of the manner in which the Pilgrim
Fathers landed, seemed like respectable old acquaintances
whom I had known and admired in happier days.</p>

<p>The man who can find one of the books that he studied
<a class="pagenum" id="page_325">[Pg 325]</a>
when he was a child at school will experience a pleasant
sensation if he will open it and look over its pages. It will
recall some delightful memories, and bring him very close
again to the almost forgotten time when that wretched
little book was to him the mightiest literary achievement in
existence. For this reason I love Goodrich's History; and
I will continue to regard it with affection even though my
judgment may not give it approval as a work of very remarkable
excellence.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Adeler descended, after tucking the weary
scholars comfortably in bed, I directed her attention to
these facts, and to some of the peculiarities of Goodrich's
effort:</p>

<p>"This little book, Mrs. A., first unlocked for me the door
of history. It is a history of the United States; and as it was
written by a man who lived in Boston and believed in Boston,
it is hardly necessary to say that in my childhood I
obtained from the volume the impression that our beloved
native land consisted chiefly of Boston. I do not wish to
revile that city. It is in many respects a model municipality.
It is, I think, better governed than any other large community
in the land, it has greater intellectual force than any
of our cities, and its people have a stronger and more demonstrative
civic pride. In Boston the best men are usually
at the front, and the conduct of public affairs is not entrusted,
as it is in Philadelphia and other cities, to blackguardly
politicians whom a respectable man would not admit
to his house, and who maintain themselves in power by
fraudulent elections and by stealing the people's money.
Every Boston man believes in the greatness of his city, and
is proud of it. That is an excellent condition of public sentiment,
and we may pardon it even if it does sometimes produce
results that are slightly ridiculous.</p>

<p>"Goodrich was what might be called an excessive Boston
<a class="pagenum" id="page_326">[Pg 326]</a>
man, and his little history is very apt, unintentionally, to
convey erroneous impressions to the infant mind. In my
early boyhood, being completely saturated with Goodrich, I
entertained an indistinct idea that the eye of Columbus
rested upon Boston long before any other object appeared
above the horizon, and somehow I cherished a conviction
that the natives who greeted him and bowed down at his
feet were men who inhabited Bunker Hill Monument and
disported themselves perpetually among the chambers of
Faneuil Hall. I never doubted that every important event
in our annals, from the landing of those unpleasant old
Puritans of the Mayflower down to the election of Andrew
Jackson, occurred in Boston, and was attributable entirely
to the remarkable superiority of the people of that city. I
scoffed at the theory that John Smith was in Virginia at the
time of his salvation by Pocahontas, and I was even disposed
to regard the account of the signing of the Declaration of
Independence at Philadelphia as a sort of an insignificant
'side show' which should have been alluded to briefly in a
foot-note. I honestly believed that the one great mistake of
George Washington's life was that he was born elsewhere
than in Boston, and I felt that, however hard such retribution
might appear, he deserved to be considered a little less
great on account of that error.</p>

<p>"As for the war of the Revolution, I could not doubt, while
I maintained my faith in Goodrich, that it was begun by the
high-spirited citizens of Boston in consequence of the wrongs
inflicted upon them by that daring and impious monarch
King George III. It was equally clear that the conflict was
carried on only by the people of Boston, and that the victory
was won at last because of the valor displayed by the citizens
of that community.</p>

<p>"In my opinion, and apparently in the opinion of Goodrich,
the leading event of the war was that related in chapter
<a class="pagenum" id="page_327">[Pg 327]</a>
eighty-five. The story occupies the whole chapter.
The historian evidently intended that the youthful mind,
while meditating upon the most important episode of the
dreadful struggle, should not be disturbed by minor matters.
Chapter eighty-five relates that certain British soldiers demolished
snow hills that had been constructed by some boys
upon Boston Common, a hallowed spot which Goodrich taught
me to regard as the pivotal point of the universe. The boys
determined to call upon General Gage, and to protest against
this brutal outrage committed by the hireling butchers of a
bloated despot. Now listen while I read the account of that
interview as it is given by Goodrich:</p>

<blockquote><p>"General Gage asked why so many children had called
upon him. 'We come, sir,' said the tallest boy, 'to demand
satisfaction,' 'What!' said the general; 'have your fathers
been teaching you rebellion, and sent you to exhibit it here?'
'Nobody sent us, sir,' answered the boy, while his cheek reddened
and his eye flashed. 'We have never injured nor insulted
your troops; but they have trodden down our snow
hills and broken the ice on our skating ground. We complained,
and they called us young rebels, and told us to help
ourselves if we could. We told the captain of this, and he
laughed at us. Yesterday our works were destroyed the
third time, and we will bear it no longer.' General Gage
looked at them a moment in silent admiration, and then said
to an officer at his side, 'The very children here draw in a
love of liberty with the air they breathe.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"The story of this event, which shaped the destinies of a
great nation and gave liberty to a continent, I learned by
heart. Many and many a night have I lain awake wishing
that Philadelphians would organize another war with Great
Britain, so that British soldiers could come over and batter
down a snow hill that I would build in Independence Square.
I felt certain that I should go at once, in such an event, to
see the general, and should overwhelm him with another
<a class="pagenum" id="page_328">[Pg 328]</a>
outburst of fiery indignation. It seemed rather hard that
Philadelphia boys should never have a chance to surpass the
boys of Boston. But still I could not help admiring those
young braves and regarding them as the real authors of
American independence. I was well assured that if that
'tallest boy' had not entered the general's room and flashed
his eye at Gage all would have been lost; the country would
have been ground beneath the iron heel of the oppressor,
and Americans would have been worse than slaves. Perhaps
it did me no harm to believe all this; but it seems to
me that we might as well instruct children properly to begin
with. Therefore I shall give our boy, Agamemnon,
some private lessons in history to supplement the wisdom of
Goodrich."</p>

<p>Just as I had concluded my remarks, Judge Pitman came
in to ask me to let him look at the evening paper which I
had brought with me from the city. I explained to him the
nature of the subject that had been considered, and the judge,
as usual, had something to say about it.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he observed, "that them school-books
that they make now-a-days is perfectly bewilderin' to a man
like me? When I went to school, we learned nothin' but
readin', writin' and arithmetic. But now&mdash;well, they've got
clear past me. I could no more rassle with the learnin' they
have at the schools now than a babe unborn."</p>

<p>"To what special department of learning do you refer?"
I inquired.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus331a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"Oh, all of 'em, all of 'em. I had a very cur'ous experience
with one o' them books once," said the judge, with a laugh.
"Some years ago I took a notion to jine the church, an' they
give me the catechism to learn afore I could git in. When
I got home, I laid the book away on the shelf, an' didn't go
for it for two or three days. When I was ready to study it
up, I reached down what I thought was the catechism, an'
<a class="pagenum" id="page_329">[Pg 329]</a>
I was kinder surprised to see that it was called 'Familiar
Science.' You understand it was
a book my daughter had been
learnin' at school. But I knowed
no better.  I never paid no
'tention to religion afore; an'
although it struck me as sorter
queer that a catechism should
have such questions and answers
in it, I thought the church people
that give me the book must
know what was right, so I said
nothin' an' went to work at it."</p>

<p>"How did you succeed?"</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus331b.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"Oh, putty good. I learned
three or four pages by heart, an' I thought that was 'bout
enough. So after while the minister an' the rest come 'round
an' begun examinin' me. I noticed that the questions kinder
didn't fit in, but I did my
best; an' when they'd ask
me about the Scripters, I'd
jam in somethin' about carbonic
acid gas, an' when
they inquired about the whole
duty of man, I desp'rately
give 'em somethin' relatin' to
the functions of lightnin'-rods."</p>

<p>"You must have astonished them."</p>

<p>"You never seen men wuss bewildered," replied the judge;
"but I think I really skeered 'em when they asked me about
Solomon's temple, an' I lit out with an answer referrin' to
smoky chimneys. They thought I was insane. But when
<a class="pagenum" id="page_330">[Pg 330]</a>
I pulled out the book an' showed it to 'em, the preacher
laughed an' told me about the mistake. Then we hunted
up the catechism an' got the thing straight. The church
folks had the laugh on me for a while, but I didn't mind it.
An' it <i>was</i> pretty fair for a joke, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Excellent."</p>

<p>"But I got a better one on at least one of them fellers.
Doctor Brindley was on the examinin' committee, an' he
run me harder than any of 'em about it. Well, sir&mdash; Do
you know old Hillegass?"</p>

<p>"No; I never heard of him."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus332.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"He lives out yer on the Wilmington road. Well, sir,
some time afore that Hillegass was putty near dead. He was
the wust case I ever seen. Broken down, thin an' pale, with
no appetite, his lungs weak, his liver good for nothin', his
legs full of rheumatics, his heart affected an' his head achin'
with neuralger, I really believe that man was the sickest
<a class="pagenum" id="page_331">[Pg 331]</a>
human bein' that ever breathed the breath of life. All the
doctors in the country had a shy at him one time an'
another; an' as he kep' a-gettin' wuss an' wuss, they made
him mad, an' he wouldn't pay their bills."</p>

<p>"He was not much to blame for that."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Well, one day them doctors met, an'
after talkin' the thing over they agreed not to go to Hillegass's
again unless he settled up, you understand. They
said, 'Now we'll let Hillegass die; we've fooled with him
long enough. He's either got to pay or perish. No more
Hillegass for us unless we see some cash.' So for about a
year they let him alone; an' whenever one of 'em would
drive past the house, he would pull up for a minute, look
to see if there was crape on the door, an' then go on, shakin'
his head an' sayin', 'Poor Hillegass! the stingy old fool's
not long for this world.'"</p>

<p>"Did he die?"</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus333.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"Die! One day Dr. Brindley felt kinder sorry for Hillegass,
an' he weakened on his resolution. So he called at the
house to see how he was gittin' on. As he went in the yard
he seen a stoutish man liftin'
a bar'l of flour in a waggin.
When the man got the bar'l
in, he seen the doctor an' come
for'ard. The doctor thought
he knew the scar on the man's
nose, but he couldn't believe
it. Howsomedever, it <i>was</i> old
Hillegass, well an' hearty as
a buck, an' able to h'ist the
roof off the barn if he'd a
mind to. You understand
that I had a very soft thing
on Brindley jes' then; an' he
<a class="pagenum" id="page_332">[Pg 332]</a>
never seemed to take no furder interest in the catechism
business when he met me. An' they don't encourage
doctors much out that way now; no, sir. They trust to luck
an' natur', which in my opinion is the best way, anyhow."</p>

<p>"A great many remarkable things seem to have happened
in this place," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes," responded the judge. "You'd hardly think it of
such a quiet town as this 'pears to be; but somehow there's
'most always somethin' lively goin' on. There was that fuss
'round at Dr. Hopkins's a couple o' year ago; did you hear
'bout that?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of."</p>

</div>

<p>"Well, we'd jes' got a new fire-engine in the
town, an' the men that run her thought they'd
play a little joke on the chief of the department
by rushin' 'round to his house an'
pretendin' it was afire. By a most unfort'nit
circumstance, the chief moved out of the
house that mornin', and Dr. Hopkins&mdash;the preacher, you
know&mdash;moved in. Them fellers come a-peltin' 'round with
the engine, an' they run up their ladders an' begun a-playin'
on the roof in a manner that skeered the Hopkinses
nearly to death. But the other fire company thought
there really was a fire, an' they come out
with their engine an' begun to squirt on
the house. The others tried to explain how
it was, but the new-comers wouldn't believe 'em, an' they
kep' a-pourin' water into the winders an' a carryin' on like
mad. So at last they got up a fight, an' they fought all
<a class="pagenum" id="page_333">[Pg 333]</a>
over the house an' on the stairs an' up an' down the
entries, until Dr. Hopkins was putty near insane; an'
when they went home, he counted up about two hundred
dollars damages, which them fellers had to
pay. Yes, it is astonishin' how they used to keep things a-movin' in
this town. An' now I really must be goin'. I'll send back the paper the
fust thing in the mornin', for certain."</p>

<p>The judge then went home; and just as he
passed out of the door Bob Parker came in with a radiant
countenance. He had succeeded in obtaining the evidence
that was needed for his vindication.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Parker had good reason for exultation. He had
in his possession testimony which exposed and completely
defeated the wretched little conspiracy organized
against him by Smiley.</p>

<p>"It was a very easy
thing to settle this business,"
said Bob. "I explained
the matter to the
members of our firm, and
they not only gave me a letter
containing very strong
expressions of confidence in
me and denouncing Stonebury
as a wholly untrustworthy and disreputable person, but
they insisted that I should make Stonebury confess. Accordingly,
a member of the firm accompanied me while I
hunted him up. We found that he had a clerkship in one
of the municipal offices, and we called to see him. He
turned absolutely white when he saw me, and looked as if
he would like to beat a retreat. But we went at him, and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_335">[Pg 335]</a>
threatened that if he did not acknowledge in writing that he
had maligned me we would prosecute him for the theft
committed while he was engaged at the store, and have him
ousted from his present position.</p>

<p>"He came down at once, and began to excuse his conduct
upon the ground that Smiley had compelled him to do as he
did. Then he made a written confession that his statements
concerning me were lies, and that he was the real author of
the letter which professed to come from Rev. Dr. Dewey.
Here it is&mdash;here are both letters; and I propose to enlighten
the Magruder intellect with them this very night."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be better to wait until to-morrow? It
is rather late now."</p>

<p>"No, sir. I intend to settle the affair finally and for ever
before I go to bed. I have been waiting long enough. Now
I am going to enjoy my victory without further delay. Let's
go around there at once."</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus337.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>So Bob and I started for the Magruder mansion; and when
we reached the street, he strode along at such a rapid gait
that I could hardly keep up with him. As we
approached the house I ventured to suggest that
the dog might perhaps be at large, in which
event I thought I would rather remain in the
drug store on the other side of the street until
he returned.</p>

<p>"I would go into the house," exclaimed Bob,
"if there were a million bloodhounds tearing
around the front yard."</p>

<p>"Well, I believe I wouldn't. I have less enthusiasm
than you. I am growing old and cautious. A
much smaller quantity of bloodhound would restrain what
little impetuosity I have. Only one vigorous bloodhound
stationed in that yard and betraying a disposition to exclude
me would dampen my ardor. I should go home at once."</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_336">[Pg 336]</a></p>

<p>"Magruder's dog won't bite," said Bob. "He knows me
well, and we needn't be a bit afraid of him."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will run the risk; but if any accident occurs,
I shall blame you for it. I would rather you should
lose your lady-love than that I should be deprived of the
use of my legs."</p>

<p>"And, of course, I wouldn't. But come along, and never
mind the dog."</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus338.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>As we entered the gate the dog was there, and he followed
us upon the porch, still manifesting intense eagerness
to sniff our trowsers. It is remarkable with
what carefulness and steadiness a man walks
under such circumstances. I would not have
made a sudden jump or a quick movement of
any kind for a valuable consideration.</p>

<p>When we entered the house, Mr. Magruder
met us, and we went with him into the library,
where Mrs. Magruder was sitting with a book in her hand.
We obtained a glimpse of Bessie as she vanished through
the other door into the next room; and Bob seemed to feel
a little disappointed that she had not remained. Mr. Magruder
began the conversation:</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Parker, I trust you have been successful in
your efforts?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Bob. "I have accomplished all that I
hoped for. I have, I think, procured evidence which will
vindicate me completely and prove that I have been grossly
slandered."</p>

<p>"I hope this is the case," said Mr. Magruder. "What is
the nature of your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here are two letters. This one is from one of my employers.
The other is written by Samuel Stonebury, a man
whose name at least is known to you."</p>

<p>Magruder took the papers and read them aloud, so that
<a class="pagenum" id="page_337">[Pg 337]</a>
his wife might obtain the information supplied by them.
Then, as he slowly folded them up, he said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Parker, this does indeed seem to be conclusive. I
blame myself very much for having reposed confidence in
Smiley and in his villainous friend, but more than all because
I treated you as if you were guilty before I heard you
in your own defence. I owe you a very humble apology, sir,
and I now make it. I hope you will forgive me;" and Magruder
extended his hand.</p>

<p>"I believed in you from the first," said Mrs. Magruder.</p>

<p>"And I thank you for it," replied Bob.</p>

<p>"I suppose Bessie might as well come in now, my dear,"
said Mr. Magruder.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied his wife, and she called Bessie.</p>

<p>Bessie had evidently been listening upon the other side of
the door, for she entered instantly, with her smiling face rosy
with blushes. Bob merely took her hand, and stood by her
looking as if he would like to indulge in a tenderer demonstration.
Then I announced my intention to go home, and
as I did so Bob said he believed he would stay a little
longer. Mr. and Mrs. Magruder came out with me into the
hall to say good-bye, and as the library-door closed I thought
I heard the sound of a kiss. I hope the old people went into
the parlor or retired to bed after my departure. There had
been a cruel separation of the two lovers, and a good deal of
genuine suffering, at least upon Bessie's part, and it was but
fair that they should have a chance to enjoy to the very utmost,
without the intrusion of another person, the bliss of
that reunion.</p>

<p>Upon the day following this reconciliation Smiley was in
town, and he called at Magruder's. The old gentleman saw
him coming, and met him at the door. In reply to Smiley's
salutation Magruder looked sternly at him, and after telling
him that his villainy had been exposed, the indignant man
<a class="pagenum" id="page_338">[Pg 338]</a>
ordered the lieutenant to leave his house and never to enter
it again. Smiley turned upon his heel and slunk away.
We have probably seen the last of him; and just as he has
disappeared we have learned that he is likely to be cashiered
from the army for bad conduct. His brother officers at the
fort have discovered his true character just as it has been
revealed to us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This rambling narrative would not deserve to be received
as a faithful record of events that have occurred in our neighborhood
if it should fail to include an account of the extraordinary
circumstances attending what is known here as
"The Great Cooley Inquest." The story of that remarkable
business must be given even if it shall be introduced
with abruptness.</p>

<p>My neighbor William Cooley had a brother named
Thomas, who lived at a place called Vandyke, in New
Castle county. Thomas Cooley was in some respects a
very remarkable man. He was gifted with genius, but it
was genius of an impracticable kind. He was an inventor,
and during the later years of his life he devoted all his
time to the work of constructing surprising machines which
would never do anything when they were constructed.</p>

<p>Down at the patent-office they got so at last that when a
new model and specifications would come along from Cooley,
the commissioner and clerks would grant him a patent on the
spot, for they knew, from a rich and generous experience,
that when Cooley invented anything it was perfectly certain
to be unlike any other contrivance ever conceived by the
mind of fallen man; and they were aware, at any rate, that
nobody who was sane enough to be at large would ever want
to interfere with Cooley's exclusive right to pin together
such a bewildering and useless lot of cranks and axles and
wheels. I think Cooley had about two hundred patents of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_339">[Pg 339]</a>
various kinds; and besides the machines and dodges thus
protected by the law, he owned scores of others
which were never heard of in Washington or
anywhere else but at Cooley's home.</p>

<p>Cooley had a kind of "den" of his own in
the garret. He used to shut himself up in
this for hours together while he perfected his
inventions or conducted his chemical investigations.
His last idea was that he could put
together a compound which would rule gunpowder
out of the market, and make the destruction
of armies and navies comparatively
easy. And so, for a time, Mrs. Cooley, while
bustling about in the vicinity of the den, instead
of hearing the buzz and hum of wheels
and the click of the hammer, would sniff terrific
smells, evolved by the irrepressible Cooley
from the contents of his laboratory. And one
day there came a fearful explosion. The roof
was torn off and reduced to splinters, and Thomas Cooley had
disappeared.</p>

<p>Vandyke, as I have said, is in New Castle county, Delaware,
but it is also close to the boundary line between Delaware
and the counties of Cecil and Kent, in Maryland.</p>

<p>And so it was not surprising when, a few minutes after the
explosion, persons in all three of the counties perceived fragments
of a demoralized and disintegrated human being
tumbling from the air. The pieces of the unhappy victim
of the disaster were unevenly distributed between New
Castle, Cecil and Kent. The first named got twelve of the
fragments. There were persons who thought Cooley might
have showed even greater partiality for his own county,
but I do not blame him; he was in a measure controlled
by circumstances.</p>

<p>I think the friends of the
coroner complained with
greatest bitterness. He was
an enthusiastic coroner.
He had been known, when
one of Dr. Tobias Jones's
relatives returned from
Egypt with a mummy embalmed
fifteen hundred years
before the Christian era, to
seize that ancient subject of
Pharaoh and summon a
jury, and sit upon it, and
brood over it and think.
And it is rumored that he
put that jury up to bringing
in a verdict, "The death of the deceased ensued from cause or
causes unknown, at the hands of persons also unknown."
His enemies at the next election openly asserted that he
charged the county with the usual fee, with compound interest
from the time of Moses.</p>

<p>So of course when Thomas Cooley went up, <i>he</i> wasn't
sorry; and the more Cooley was scattered over New Castle
county, the more serene and affable the coroner felt. When
he had selected his jury and looked around him a little in
order to command the situation, he perceived that Cooley
had put into his hands a tolerably good thing. The coroner
spent the next three days holding an inquest upon each of
the twelve fragments of the deceased. He empaneled a new
jury every time, and then proceeded cautiously and deliberately
in each case.</p>

<p>There was by no means complete unanimity of opinion.
The first jury decided that "the deceased met his death by
being struck by something sudden." The second one advanced
<a class="pagenum" id="page_341">[Pg 341]</a>
the theory that "Thomas Cooley was surreptitiously
and insidiously blowed apart." The others threw out suggestions
respecting the probability that the trouble came
from Cooley's well-known weakness for flying machines, or
from his being lifted out and cut up by some kind of a hurricane.
Once the jury decided not to bring in a verdict, but
merely to pass resolutions of regret.</p>

<p>And the coroner would sit there over the particular piece
of Cooley in question, and smile and permit these manifestations
of generous feeling to have full play. It didn't perplex
<i>him</i> that all the verdicts differed. "Truth," he remarked
to a friend, "is well enough. But as Cooley is certainly
dead, what's the odds if we can't agree as to what
killed him? Let us collect our fees and yield with Christian
resignation to destiny."</p>

<p>It was always interesting to me to hear that coroner converse
upon the subject of resignation. He would rather have
died than to have resigned while any of the Cooleys were in
town inventing explosive compounds.</p>

<p>The Cecil county coroner discovered six pieces of the deceased
within his jurisdiction, but his pride would not permit
him to yield the supremacy in such a matter to his rival over
the line. The New Castle man had twelve inquests, and so
would he, with more besides. And his juries used to go out
and consult and come in after a while with a majority report,
declaring, perhaps, that deceased was killed by fooling with
some sort of a gun, and a minority report insisting
that he had been murdered and dissected by
a medical student or students unknown.</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus343.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>And then the coroner would disband the inquest
and drum up a fresh jury, which would
also disagree, until out of those six fractions of poor old
Cooley the coroner got thirty-seven deliberations, with the
attendant fees. And every time the doctors would testify
<a class="pagenum" id="page_342">[Pg 342]</a>
that <i>post-mortem</i> examinations revealed the fact that the
inside of the deceased was crammed with fragments of the
Latin language; and invariably the jurors would sit there
and try to look as if they understood those terms, although
a dim impression prevailed most of the time that the physicians
were indulging recklessly in profanity.</p>

<p>And when a relative of Cooley's testified before the thirty-seventh
jury that "Thomas Cooley was a man of marked
idiosyncrasies, and his brain was always excited by his irresistible
fondness for chimeras of various kinds," the jury
looked solemn and immediately brought in a verdict that
"death was caused by idiosyncrasies forming on his brain in
consequence of excessive indulgence in chimeras, thus supplying
an awful warning to the young to refrain from the
use of that and other intoxicating beverages."</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illus344.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>Only two pieces fell in Kent county, but the coroner was
animated by even greater professional enthusiasm than his
neighbors across the border. He spent the entire season
over as much of Cooley as he could reach. All his juries
but one disagreed, and he had eighty-four. The sixth would
have been unanimous but for an obstinate man named Selfridge.
All the others were for a verdict of mysterious
butchery, but Selfridge insisted upon attributing the disaster
to nitro-glycerine. So earnest was he that he fought over
the subject with a fellow-juryman named Smith; and he held Smith down
and remonstrated with him, and showed him the matter in different lights,
and bit his nose to convince Smith that
<a class="pagenum" id="page_343">[Pg 343]</a>
the nitro-glycerine hypothesis was correct. And when the
jury was dismissed, Selfridge, true to his solemn convictions,
carried the war into the papers, and published an obituary
poem entitled "A Monody on the Death of Thomas Cooley,"
in which he presented his views in this fashion:</p>

<ol>
<li>"When Cooley got his glycerine all properly adjusted,</li>
<li>He knocked it unexpectedly, and suddenly it busted;</li>
<li>And when it reached old Thomas C., he got up quick and dusted,</li>
<li>And left his wife and family disheartened and disgusted."</li>
</ol>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus345.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>It was discovered that one of the bones of the deceased had
fallen directly across the boundary line between Cecil and
Kent. As soon as the fact was reported, the coroner of
Kent rallied a jury upon his end; and just as the proceedings
were about to begin, the Cecil coroner arrived with a
jury for the purpose of attending to his share of the work.
While the authorities of Kent mused at one end of the bone,
the jurymen of Cecil reflected at the other end, and the result
was that each brought in an entirely different verdict.
But they were unanimous on the question of the collection
of fees.</p>

<p>In all there were thirteen or fourteen conflicting verdicts
rendered, and so some uncertainty prevailed as to the precise
cause of Cooley's death. Men's minds were unsettled,
and their conclusions were demoralized, in the presence of
so much official authority of an indecisive kind. But nobody
mourned over these differences. They were a blessing
for the people of the counties. Almost every man in the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_344">[Pg 344]</a>
neighborhood had had a turn at Cooley's remains, and some
of them had served on the juries six or seven times. The
farmers all bought new mowing-machines that spring with
their fees. The doctors collected more money for <i>post-mortem</i>
examinations than they would have done in a time of an
epidemic of small-pox and sudden death. People fixed up
their houses and paid off mortgages and laid in their pork
and started grocery stores and gave hops out of the profits
of Cooley's explosion. And there were men who cherished
a wish that Cooley could be put together again and exploded
once a month for the next decade. But that of course was impossible.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus346.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>One day, when the tide of prosperity was at its height,
the widow Cooley perceived a wagon driving up to her
door. The man within the vehicle dismounted, and unloaded
four pieces of iron pipe sixty feet long. Presently
another wagon arrived, and this driver also unloaded the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_345">[Pg 345]</a>
same quantity of pipe. Then a third driver arrived and did
the same thing. Then a fourth came, and Mrs. Cooley saw
a man in it with a queer-looking object by him. It proved
to be Thomas Cooley himself. Thomas had been up to the
city at a machine-shop getting up a working model of a new
kind of a patent duplex elliptic artesian pump; and now he
was home again. The remains scattered over the counties
were&mdash;so Cooley said&mdash;merely a lot of beef with which he
had been trying to make a new kind of patent portable soup
and an improved imperishable army sausage; and the explosion,
he thought, must have been caused by spontaneous
combustion.</p>

<p>Thomas Cooley would have been happy, after all, but for
one thing&mdash;everybody outside of his own family refused to
recognize him as a living man. If he was willing to move
about in the community in the character of an unburied
corpse, the people would agree not to interfere and not to
insist upon his burial; but that was as far as they could go
conscientiously. Their duty to society, their obligations to
the law, compelled them to reject the idea that he was anything
more than inanimate remains. He was officially dead.
The fact had been declared under oath by hundreds of jurymen,
and it was registered in the records of two States and
three counties. The testimony was overwhelmingly against
him. To admit that he was still alive would be dangerous,
it would be revolutionary. The foundations of society would
be shaken, the majesty of the law would suffer insult, the
fabric of republican government would be undermined. If
a being who was legally only a mere cadaver was to be permitted
to strut out into daylight, and to urge incendiary
theories about the condition of his vital spark, nothing would
be safe; there would be no guarantee that the cemeteries
would not unload, and that all of the departed would not be
crowding out and wanting to vote. Besides, if it was admitted
<a class="pagenum" id="page_346">[Pg 346]</a>
that Cooley was yet alive, all the money that had
been earned by the jurymen, all the fees that had been
charged by the coroners, would have to be returned to the
county treasuries. The people were aghast at the thought.
The coroners entered into a solemn compact to persist in
ignoring Cooley or to regard him merely as an absurd and
very indelicate goblin who had behaved in a manner wholly
unworthy of a ghost with gentlemanly instincts. They declared
publicly that they could not admit that Cooley was
alive unless there should be a general resurrection in the
States of Delaware and Maryland, and until that time
arrived, they considered that the best thing Cooley could do
would be to select a sepulchre somewhere and creep into it
and behave.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I do not know that I can find a better place than this
to insert a bundle of rhymes which I have at hand. The
wholesale slaughter in which the hero and heroine indulge
seems to entitle the poem to association with the three coroners
above mentioned. And I may venture to remark that
not one of the officials in question will read the lines without
a feeling of profound regret that such magnificent opportunities
for inquests are hardly likely to be presented in Maryland
and Delaware. Our New Castle coroner would accumulate
millions in the shape of fees if he could have the
privilege of summoning juries to investigate such a butchery
as this.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">A Hindoo Legend.</span></h2>

<ol>
<li>There was a Hindoo maiden once on India's coral strand</li>
<li>Who had some forty suitors for her coffee-colored hand.</li>
<li>Her father was a Brahmin of aristocratic caste</li>
<li>Who much internal revenue in dry goods had amassed.</li>
</ol>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_347">[Pg 347]</a></p>

<ol><li>These lovers thought it would be nice the dusky maid to wed,</li>
<li>And spend the rupees lavishly when her papa was dead.</li>
<li>But she turned up her nose at them&mdash;a very pretty pug&mdash;</li>
<li>Because clandestinely she loved an elegant young Thug.</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>This Thug, in his profession, was a very active man;</li>
<li>He strangled eighty men the year to practice he began.</li>
<li>But as the maiden's father had no taste for art at all,</li>
<li>He foolishly disliked the Thug, and wouldn't let him call.</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>And then she loved him better still, as always is the case,</li>
<li>And so she met him daily at a certain trysting-place.</li>
<li>Hand in hand amid the verdant fields deliciously they strayed,</li>
<li>Now culling flowers, now strangling little children as they played.</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>And this young Thug, one afternoon, he kissed the maid and said,</li>
<li>"It really seems to me, my dear, high time that we should wed.</li>
<li>And as your guardians to me so seriously object,</li>
<li>'Twould be as well to kill them; I can do it, I expect."</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>Then said the lovely maiden, with a sweet, confiding smile:</li>
<li>"I go for chopping of them up in most effectual style.</li>
<li>And as my marriage simply on my papa's death depends,</li>
<li>Why, just for fun we'll butcher all my relatives and friends."</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>The Thug procured a hatchet, and the maiden got a knife;</li>
<li>They cut and slashed the Brahmin till he was bereft of life;</li>
<li>Then they seized the loving mother, though she desperately fought,</li>
<li>And crunched her aged bones beneath the car of Juggernaut.</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>A consecrated lasso, thrown with admirable skill,</li>
<li>Swiftly roped her brother in and choked him 'gainst his will.</li>
<li>Her sister's fair young form was hooked upon the sacred swing;</li>
<li>And flying 'round until she died, she screamed like everything.</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>The maiden jabbed the knife into the colored coachman's brain,</li>
<li>And stabbed her uncle William and her aunt Matilda Jane.</li>
<li>The Thug he steeped his hatchet in the chambermaiden's gore,</li>
<li>And with a skewer pinned the cook against the cellar door.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>The maiden cut her grandpa up in little tiny bits,</li>
<li>And scared her grandma so she died in epileptic fits.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_348">[Pg 348]</a></li>
<li>The dry nurse with the clothes-line was serenely strangled, while</li>
<li>They tossed the little baby to the sacred crocodile.</li>
</ol>

<div class="figcenter w50">
<img src="images/illus350.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<ol>
<li>And when the fuss was over, said the maiden to the Thug:</li>
<li>"You'd better have a hole within the cemetery dug;</li>
<li>And let the undertaker take extraordinary pains</li>
<li>To decently inter this lot of mangled-up remains."</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>And when the usual bitter tears were at the funeral shed,</li>
<li>The lovers to the temple went, in order to be wed.</li>
<li>The priest had barbecued a man that day for sacrifice;</li>
<li>They cooked him with the cracklin' on; with gravy brown and nice.</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>The chief priest asked the maiden, when the services began,</li>
<li>If her papa had said she might annex this fine young man?</li>
<li>"Oh no," she said, "my loving wish he foolishly withstood,</li>
<li>So him and all the family we slaughtered in cold blood."</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>"You shock me!" said the pious priest; "your conduct makes me sad;</li>
<li>You never learned at Sunday-school to be so awful bad.</li>
<li>I've told you often, when you killed a person anywhere,</li>
<li>To bring the body to that old nine-headed idol there;</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_349">[Pg 349]</a></li>
</ol>

<ol><li>"The great Vishnu is suffering for victims every day,</li>
<li>And here you go and cut them up and throw the bones away!</li>
<li>Extravagance is sinful; I must really put it down;</li>
<li>I've half a mind to pull the string and make the idol frown.</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>"I must punish you with rigor; and I order that you two</li>
<li>Instead of getting married shall severest penance do."</li>
<li>So on a piece of paper then he scribbled a brief word;</li>
<li>The lovers as they left, of course, felt perfectly absurd.</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>The Thug then read the order o'er, and bursting into tears,</li>
<li>He said, "This paper realizes my unpleasant fears.</li>
<li>Upon my word, my sweetest one, it really chills my blood;</li>
<li>I've got to suffocate you in the Ganges' holy mud."</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>And so he sadly led her down unto the river's bank,</li>
<li>And like a stone into the cold, religious slime she sank.</li>
<li>And there she stuck the livelong day, and all the following night.</li>
<li>Until an alligator came and ate her at a bite.</li>
</ol>

<ol><li>The Thug he felt exceeding hurt at her untimely fate,</li>
<li>But his, though not so dreadful, was not nice, at any rate.</li>
<li>The priest, in his fierce anger, had condemned him, it appears,</li>
<li>To stand alone upon one leg for forty-seven years!</li>

<p>A very mysterious package
came to me through the
post-office yesterday. I
brought it home unopened,
and, as is usual in such
cases, we began to speculate
upon the nature of
the contents before we
broke the seals. Everybody
has a disposition to
dally for a while with a
letter or a package from
an unknown source. Mrs.
Adeler felt the parcel
carefully, and said she
was sure it was something
from her aunt&mdash;something for the baby, probably. Bob
imagined that it was an infernal machine forwarded by the
revengeful Stonebury, and he insisted that I should put it to
soak in a bucket of water for a few hours before removing
the wrapper. The children were hopeful that some benign
fairy had adopted this method of supplying the Adeler
<a class="pagenum" id="page_351">[Pg 351]</a>
family with supernatural confectionery; and for my part,
I had no doubt that some one of my friends among the publishers
had sent me half a dozen of the latest books.</p>

<p>We opened the bundle gradually. When the outside
casing was torn away, another envelope remained, and as
this was slowly removed the excitement and curiosity reached
an almost painful degree of intensity. At last all the papers
were taken off, and I lifted from among them a large black
volume. It was only a patent-office report sent to me by
that incorruptible statesman and devoted patriot, the Congressman
from our State.</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus353.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>I have endeavored to conjecture why he should have
selected me as the object of such a demonstration. Certainly
he did not expect me to read the report. He knows
that I, as a man of at least ordinary intelligence, would endure
torture first. I cannot think that he hoped to purchase
my vote by such a cheap expedient. Congressmen
do, I believe, still cherish the theory that the present of a
patent-office report to a constituent secures for
the donor the fealty of the recipient; but it is a
delusion. Such a gift fills the soul of an unoffending
man with gloomy and murderous
thoughts. Every one feels at times as if he
would like to butcher some of his fellow-men;
and my appetite for slaughter only becomes
keen when I meet a Congressman who has sent
me a patent-office report. Neither can I accept
the suggestion that my representative was deceived
by the supposition that I would be grateful for such
an intimation that an eminent man, even amid the oppressive
cares of State, has not forgotten so humble a worm as I. He
knows me well; and although I am aware that there is in
Washington a prevalent theory that a wild thrill of exultation
agitates the heart of a constituent when he receives a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_352">[Pg 352]</a>
public document or a flatulent oration from a lawmaker, my
Congressman is better informed. He would not insult me
in such a manner. I can only account for his conduct upon
the theory that he misdirected the volume, which he intended
for some one else, or upon the supposition that he has heard
me speak of the necessity for the occasional bombardment
of Cooley's dog at night, and he conceived that he would be
helping a good cause by supplying me with a new and
formidable missile. I have never attacked a dog with a
patent-office report, but I can imagine that the animal
might readily be slain with such a weapon. A projectile
should have ponderosity; and a patent-office report has
more of that quality to the cubic inch than any other object
with which I am familiar. Still, I do not care to tax the
treasury of the United States for material with which to
assail Cooley's dog. I would rather endure the nocturnal
ululations, and have the money applied to the liquidation
of the national debt.</p>

<p>It is, however, apparent that Congressmen will never
surrender the patent-office report; and if this is admitted,
it seems to me that the man who succeeds in infusing into
those volumes such an amount of interest that people will
be induced to read them will have a right to be regarded as
a great public benefactor. I suppose no human being ever
did read one of them. It is tolerably certain that any man
who would deliberately undertake to peruse one from beginning
to end would be regarded as a person who ought
not to be at large. His friends would be justified in placing
him in an asylum. I think I can suggest a method by
which a reform can be effected. It is to take the material
that comes to hand each year and to work it up into a continuous
story, which may be filled in with tragedy and sentiment
and humor.</p>

<p>For instance, if a man came prowling around the patent-office
<a class="pagenum" id="page_353">[Pg 353]</a>
with an improvement in hayrakes, I should name
that man Alphonso and start him off in the story as the
abandoned villain; Alphonso lying in wait, as it were, behind
a dark corner, for the purpose of scooping his rival with
that improved hay-rake. And then the hero
would be a man, suppose we say, who desired
an extension of a patent on accordeons. I
should call such a person Lucullus, and plant
him, with a working model of the accordeon,
under the window of the boarding-house where
the heroine, Amelia, who would be a woman
who had applied for a patent on a new kind
of red flannel frills, lay sleeping under the
soothing influence of the tunes squeezed from
the accordeon of Lucullus.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus356b.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>In the midst of the serenade, let us suppose, in comes a
man who has just got out some extraordinary kind of a fowling-piece
about which he wants to interview the head of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_354">[Pg 354]</a>
department. I should make this being Amelia's father and
call him Smith, because that name is full of
poetry and sweetness and wild, unearthly
music. Then, while Lucullus was mashing
out delicious strains, I might make Alphonso
rush on Smith with his hay-rake, thinking he
was Lucullus, and in the fight which would perhaps ensue
Smith might blow out Alphonso's brains somehow on the
spot by a single discharge, we might assume,
of Smith's extraordinary fowling-piece, while
Lucullus could be arrested upon the suit of
the composer who had a copyright on the
tune with which he solaced Amelia.</p>

<p>If any ingenious undertaker should haunt
the patent-office at this crisis of the story with
a species of metallic coffin, I might lay Alphonso
away comfortably in one of them and
have a funeral, or I might add a thrill of interest
to the narrative by resuscitating him
with vegetable pills, in case any benefactor
of the race should call to secure his rights as
the sole manufacturer of such articles. In
the mean time, Lucullus, languishing in jail,
could very readily burst his fetters and regain
his liberty, provided some man of inventive
talent called on the commissioner to
take out searches, say, on some kind of a revertible crowbar.</p>

<p>Then the interest of the story would be sustained, and a
few more machines of various kinds could be worked in, if,
for instance, I should cause this escaped convict of mine to
ascertain that the musical composer had won the heart of
Amelia, in the absence of her lover, by offering to bring her
flannel frills into market, and to allow her a royalty, we will
<a class="pagenum" id="page_355">[Pg 355]</a>
assume, of ten cents a frill. When Lucullus hears of this,
I should induce him to try to obtain the influence of Amelia's
parents in his behalf by propitiating old Mr. Smith with
the latest variety of bunion plaster for which a patent was
wanted, while Mrs. Smith could be appeased either with a
gingham umbrella with an improvement of six or seven extra
ribs, or else a lot of galvanized gum rings, if any inventor
brought such things around, for her grandchildren.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Then, for the sake of breaking the monotony of these intrigues,
we could have a little more of the revivified Alphonso.
I could very readily fill the heart of that reanimated
corpse with baffled rage, and cause him to sell to old
Smith one of McBride's improved hydraulic rams. Smith
could be depicted as an infatuated being who placed that
ram down in the meadow and caused it to force water up to
his house. And Alphonso, of course, with malignant hatred
in his soul, would meddle with the machine, and fumble
around until he spoiled it, so that Smith could not stop it,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_356">[Pg 356]</a>
and it would continue to pump until the Smiths had a cascade
flowing from their attic window. Mrs. Smith, in her
despair, might impale herself on a variety of reversible toasting-fork,
and die mingling the inventor's name with maledictions
and groans, while Smith, in the anguish of his soul,
could live in the barn, from whence he could use an ingenious
kind of breech-loading gun&mdash;patent applied for&mdash;to perforate
artists who came around to sketch the falls.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Lucullus might come to the rescue with
a suction pump and save the Smith mansion, only to find
that Amelia had flown with the composer, and had gone to
sea in a ship with a patent copper bottom, and a kind of a
binnacle for which an extension had been granted by Congress
on the 26th of February. It would then be well, perhaps,
to have that copper-bottomed ship attacked by pirates,
and after a bloody hand-to-hand contest, in which the composer
could sink the pirate craft with the model of a gunpowder
pile-driver which he has in the cabin, the enraged
corsairs should swarm upon the deck of the other ship for
the purpose of putting the whole party to the sword. And,
of course, at this painful crisis it would be singularly happy
to cause it to turn out that the chief pirate is our old friend
Alphonso, who had sold out his interest in his hay-rake, discontinued
his speculations in hydraulic rams and become a rover upon the seas.</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illus358.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>The composer, it would seem, would then be in a particularly
tight place; and if the commissioner of patents
had any romance in his soul, he would permit me to cause
<a class="pagenum" id="page_357">[Pg 357]</a>
that pirate to toss the musician overboard. Amelia would
then tear herself from the pirate's loathsome embrace and
plunge in after him. The two would float ashore on a liferaft,
if any applications of that kind happened to be presented
to the department. When they got to land, Amelia
would shiver with cold until her jaws rattled, and the painful
truth would be disclosed to her lover that she wore teeth
which were attached to one of the gutta-percha plates about
which there was a controversy in the courts.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus359.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>Then, if we seemed to be approaching the end of the report,
I think I would cause the composer to shriek "False!
false!" or to use some exciting language of that kind, and to
tear out his hair and wring his
nose and fly off with a broken
heart and a blasted life to join
the pirates and to play melancholy
airs in a minor key, expressive
of delusive dreams, for ever and for ever, upon some
kind of a double-barreled flute with a copyright on it.</p>

<p>Thus even the prosaic material of which the patent-office
reports are constructed could be made to yield entertainment
and instruction, and afford a basis of succulent and suggestive
fact for a superstructure of pathetic and blood-curdling fiction.
The advantages of adopting such a method in constructing
these documents would be especially marked in the case of
Congressmen. The member who now sends a patent-office
report to one of his constituents is regarded by that man as
a kind of moral ruin who ought to be put in some place
where it would be impossible for him to destroy the happiness
and poison the peace of unoffending families. But when
a competent novelist prepares those reports, when he throws
over them the glamour of his fancy, when he adorns them with
his graceful rhetoric, and gives a certain intense human interest
to all the hay-rakes and gum rings and suction pumps which
<a class="pagenum" id="page_358">[Pg 358]</a>
now fill the leaden pages, these reports will be sought after;
their tone will be changed; children will cry for them; Sunday-schools
will offer them as rewards, and the intelligent
American voter whose mind craves healthy literature will
elect to Congress the man who will promise to send him the
greatest number of copies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here is the story of a tragical event of which I was
a witness, and which has created a profound impression
upon the people of this community.</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illus360.jpg" width="100%"

title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>An aunt of Bessie Magruder's lives at Salem; and as she
had never seen Bob, she invited him and his betrothed to
visit her one day last week, coupling the invitation with a
request that we and the elder Magruders would come at the
same time and take dinner with her. When the boat from
up the river arrived at New Castle, the entire party of us
went aboard. As the steamer shot across the water to Delaware
City, Bob and Bessie wandered away by themselves,
while the rest of us passed the
time pleasantly in conversation.
At Delaware City we
came out of the cabin to
watch the people as they
passed over the gangway.
To our surprise and vexation,
Lieutenant Smiley appeared
among them. As
he pressed forward in the
throng some one jostled him
roughly, when he uttered a
fierce oath and aimed a blow
at the offender. It missed
the mark, and he plunged
forward heavily. He would
<a class="pagenum" id="page_359">[Pg 359]</a>
have fallen had not one of the boat's crew caught him
in his arms. We saw then that he was intoxicated.</p>

<p>I watched Bob as he looked at the wretched man. His
face flushed with indignation as he recalled the injury done
to him by Smiley, and he looked as if he would have found
intense satisfaction in an attempt to give the lieutenant a
thrashing on the spot. But he did not contemplate such a
performance, and Bessie clung tightly to his arm, half afraid
that he might have a sudden and irresistible impulse to revenge,
and half afraid lest Smiley might make some shocking
demonstration against the party in that public place. As he
staggered past us he recognized us; and, brutalized as he
was with liquor, he seemed to feel the shame of his condition
and the infamy of his past conduct. He went away to
the other side of the boat and concealed himself from view.</p>

<p>When the vessel left the wharf and proceeded down the
bay, past the fort, we walked about the lower deck, looking
at the scenery and at the shipping which thronged the water.
No one of us perceived Smiley or knew that he was near us.
We had, indeed, suffered ourselves to forget the scene we
had just witnessed, and we were speaking of other matters.
As I stood by the railing with my wife and the Magruders,
Bob and Bessie came out from the cabin, and Bob had just
spoken one word, when a man came with a hurried and uneven
step to the gangway. It was Smiley. He had been
sitting in the corner behind one of the beams of the boat,
with his hat pulled over his eyes. The rail at the gangway
swings aside to admit of passage to and from the wharf.
Now it opened out upon the water. Smiley paused for one
moment, with his fingers clenched upon it; then he flung it
wide open, and leaped forward into the sea.</p>

<p>A cry of horror came from the lips of those who saw him
make the plunge, and instantly the steamer resounded with
screams for help. Before any of us could recover from the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_360">[Pg 360]</a>
paralysis of terror occasioned by the act, Smiley rose to the
surface far away from the boat, and with a shriek so awful,
so full of agony and despair, that it chilled the blood of those
who heard it, he threw up his arms and sank. In a second
Bob tossed off his coat, and before I could restrain him he
leaped into the water. He rose instantly, and struck out
boldly in the direction in which Smiley had been seen.</p>

<div class="figcenter w50">
<img src="images/illus362.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>Bessie almost fainted in her father's arms, and Mrs.
Adeler was white with fear. The next moment the steamer
stopped, and an attempt was made to lower the boat. The
operation required time; and meanwhile, Bob, who is a good
swimmer, gallantly cleft his way through the waves. I
think Smiley never rose again. For as I entered the lifeboat
<a class="pagenum" id="page_361">[Pg 361]</a>
I could see Bob turning about and endeavoring to
swim toward the steamer. He was a long way from us, for
the vessel had gone far before her headway could be overcome.
Our boatmen pulled with desperate energy lest the
brave fellow should be unable to sustain himself; and as I
stood in the stern and watched him with eager eyes, I could
see that he gave signs of being in distress. It was heavy
work in the water, with his clothing on, and the sea was
rough. We were within a hundred yards of him when he
sank, and I felt my heart grow sick as I saw him dragged
beneath the waves.</p>

<p>But as we reached the spot one of the men, who was leaning
over the side, uttered an exclamation; and extending his
arms, he pulled the lad's
head and shoulders above
the surface. A moment
later he was in the boat, but
insensible. As we turned
about to seek the steamer,
we rubbed his hands and his
temples and strove to bring
him back to life, and we
seemed to have partial success.</p>

<div class="figright w50">
<img src="images/illus363.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>But when we reached the
vessel and placed him upon
the cushions in the cabin,
we committed him to better
hands than ours. Mrs. Magruder's
medical skill then was of the highest service. She
cared for the poor lad with a motherly tenderness which was
as admirable as her art. In a brief while he revived; and
though suffering greatly, he seemed sure of life. It would
have made him blush, even in his weakness, to have heard
<a class="pagenum" id="page_362">[Pg 362]</a>
the praises heaped upon him for his splendid courage; we
rejoiced at them, but we rejoiced more to think how he had
avenged himself upon his enemy by an act of sublime self-sacrifice.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus364a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>And so, as he came back to consciousness, we neared our
journey's end; and while we carried Bob from the boat to
the carriage and placed him among his loving friends, we
shuddered to think how the wretched man who had wrought
so much evil was even now sweeping past us in the embrace
of that swift current to burial beneath the rolling billows of
the sea.</p>

<span class="smcap">Pitman as a Politician&mdash;He is Nominated for the Legislature&mdash;How
he was Serenaded, and what the Result was&mdash;I take a Hand at Politics&mdash;The Story of
my First Political Speech&mdash;My Reception at Dover&mdash;Misery

</div>

<p>Some of the friends of Judge
Pitman induced him, just before
the last election, to permit
himself to be nominated
for the State Legislature,
and accordingly he was presented
to the people of this
community as a candidate.
Of course he was not selected
because of his fitness for
the position. The party
managers knew him to be a
very popular man; and as
the success of the party is
the only thing they care for,
they chose Pitman as the person most likely to secure that
result. I cannot say that I disapproved of the selection.
For some reason, it appears to be entirely impossible for
American citizens who live in any of the Middle States to
find educated and intelligent men who are willing to represent
them in the Legislatures. Those bodies are composed
for the most part of men whose solitary purpose is plunder.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_364">[Pg 364]</a>
They are legislators simply because it pays better to blackmail
railroad companies and to accept bribes from people
who want votes for rascally measures than it does to pick
pockets. They have the instincts and the principles of a
pickpocket, but their ambition is greater. They do not steal
handkerchiefs and watches, because they can filch fabulous
sums of money from the public treasury and from villains
who want to do dirty work under the color of the law.
They know enough to enable them, with the assistance of
party rings, to have themselves counted in at election-time,
and to devise new and dexterous schemes of dishonesty; but
in other and rather more desirable of the qualifications of
law-makers they are deficient. They occupy the most important
place in republican governments without knowing
what republicanism means, and they create laws for the
communities without having any knowledge of the science
of law or the slightest acquaintance with the needs and requirements
of the people for whom they act. The average
American legislator is both ignorant and dishonest. Judge
Pitman is ignorant, but he is honest; and as his election
would secure at least a very important half of a fitting legislator,
I supported him.</p>

<p>My other neighbor, Cooley, was the chairman of the committee
to whose care was consigned the management of the
campaign in which Judge Pitman played so prominent a
part; and Cooley conducted the business with even an excess
of enthusiasm. Just after the nomination of Pitman,
Cooley called on him to say that a number of his friends
had declared their intention to offer him a serenade. Cooley
informed the judge that some refreshment must be given to
the serenaders, but he, as the chairman of the committee,
would attend to that; the judge need not make preparations
of any kind. Accordingly, on the following evening a brass
band, accompanied by a score or two politicians, entered Pitman's
<a class="pagenum" id="page_365">[Pg 365]</a>
front yard, and for half an hour there was some very
good music. Then the judge came out upon the porch and
made a better speech than I had expected to hear from him.
He concluded by asking the company to enter his house.
Cooley was there with a wagon-load of meat and drink, including,
of course, a large quantity of rum of the most impressive
kinds. The judge, with the fear of the temperance
society present in his mind, protested against the liquor; but
Cooley demonstrated to him that he would be defeated and
the party ruined if it was excluded, and so Pitman reluctantly
permitted it to be placed upon his table. Besides, as Cooley
had been so very liberal in undertaking to make this provision
at his own cost, the judge disliked to hurt his feelings
by refusing to permit the use of that which Cooley evidently
considered the most important portion of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus367.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>The guests remained at the banquet until four o'clock the
next morning, the politicians meanwhile making speeches
and the band playing occasionally in the dining-room in a
most uproarious manner. We could hear the noise at my
house during the night, and sleep was possible only with the
windows closed.</p>

<p>At four o'clock my door-bell rang violently; and upon descending
to ascertain the cause of a visit at such an unseemly
hour, I encountered Judge Pitman. He was nearly frantic
with indignation.</p>

<p>"Adeler," he said, "them fellers is a-carryin' on scand'lus
over yer at my house. They're all drunk as owls; an'
when I want 'em to go home, they laugh an' swear an' cheer
<a class="pagenum" id="page_366">[Pg 366]</a>
an' smash the furniture an' bu'st things generally. Mrs.
Pitman's 'bout skeered to death. Can't you come over an'
help me clear them out?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you call a couple of policemen? You hunt
up two or three officers while I dress myself, and we will see
if we can't adjourn the meeting."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus368.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>By the time I was ready Pitman arrived with one policeman,
and we proceeded to his house. As we entered, the
leader of the band was sitting upon the stairs, infamously
drunk, with the handle of his umbrella in his mouth, vainly
endeavoring to play a tune by fumbling his fingers among
the ribs. Mr. Cooley was in a corner of the parlor supporting
himself by the wall while he endeavored to discuss the
question of the tariff with Pitman's plaster bust of Daniel
Webster, and to correct Daniel's view of the local option
law. Another politician was sitting upon the carpet crying
because, so he informed us, his wife's maiden name was McCarthy,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_367">[Pg 367]</a>
and just as the policeman was removing him a combat
occurred between the bass drummer and a man from
Wilmington, during which the drummer was hurled against
the pier glass and then dragged out to bleed
upon the rug. The house was finally cleared
of the company just as the church clock
struck six, and then Pitman went to bed
with sentiments of complete disgust for politics
and politicians.</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus369.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>But he remained a candidate of the party. He had
promised to run, and he determined to go through with the
business.</p>

<p>"That serenade was rough enough without anythin' wuss,"
said the judge to me a day or two afterward; "but I did
think Cooley was a-rubbin' it in 'most too hard when he come
over yesterday with a bill for the refreshments which he
wanted me to pay."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought he agreed to supply the supper?"</p>

<p>"So he did. But now he says that of course he was only
actin' for me. 'The candidate,' he says, 'always foots all
the bills.' I'll foot this one, an' then I'll foot Cooley if he
ever brings them ruffians to my house agin. I expect
nothin' else but the temperance society will shut down on
me for that riot we had t'other night."</p>

<p>"I hope not; but I should think that affair would have
made you sorry that you ever undertook this business."</p>

<p>"So it does," replied the judge, "but I never back down
when I go into a thing. I'm goin' to run for the Legislatur';
and if I'm elected, I'm goin' to serve my country honestly
until my time's up. Then I'm comin' home, an' goin' to stay
home. And what's more, I'll stir up that Legislatur' while
I'm in it. You mind me!"</p>

<p>The result of the contest was that the judge was elected by
a large majority, and he will sit in the next Assembly.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_368">[Pg 368]</a></p>

<p>I played a peculiar part in the campaign; and although
the narrative of my experience as an amateur politician is
not a particularly grateful one to me, it might as well be
given, if for no other reason, because it will serve to warn
others against the fate that befel me.</p>

<p>I had for some time entertained a strong conviction that
nature designed me for an orator. I was assured that I
possessed the gift of eloquence which enables great speakers
to sway the passions of the multitude, and I felt that I
needed but the opportunity to reveal this fact to the world.
Accordingly, at the beginning of the political campaign of
which I speak I sent my name to one of the executive
committees of the State, in Wilmington, with the request
that it might be written down with the names of the speakers
who could be called upon whenever important meetings were
held. I waited impatiently all through the campaign for a
summons to appear and electrify the people. It did not
come, and I was almost in despair. But on the day before
the election I received from the chairman a brief note, saying
that I had been announced to speak at Dover that evening
before a great mass meeting, and requesting me to take
the early afternoon train, so that I might report to the local
chairman in Dover before nightfall. The pleasure with
which this summons was received was in some measure
marred by the fact that I had not a speech ready, and the
time was so short that elaborate preparation was impossible.
But I determined to throw into some sort of shape the ideas
and arguments which would readily occur to the mind of a
man familiar with the ordinary political questions of the
day and with the merits of the candidates, and to trust to
the inspiration of the occasion for the power to present them
forcibly and eloquently.</p>

<p>Of course it was plain that anything like an attempt
at gorgeousness in such a speech would be foolish, so I concluded
<a class="pagenum" id="page_369">[Pg 369]</a>
to speak plainly and directly to the point, and to
enliven my argument with some amusing campaign stories.
In order to fix my points firmly in my mind and to ensure
their presentation in their proper order, they were numbered
and committed to memory, each argument and its
accompanying anecdote being associated with a particular
arithmetical figure. The synopsis, if it may be called by
that name, presented an appearance something like the following,
excepting that it contained a specification of the
points of the speech which need not be reproduced here.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Speech.</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>1. Exordium, concluding with Scott's famous lines, "Breathes
there a man with soul so dead," etc.</p>

<p>2. Arguments, introducing a narrative of the facts in the case
of Hotchkiss, who was locked out upon the roof of his house
all night. (See particulars farther on.) The design of the story
is to give a striking picture of the manner in which the opposition
party will be left out in the cold by the election. (Make
this strong, and pause for cheers.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus371.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>3. Arguments, followed by the story of the Kickapoo Indian
who saw a locomotive approaching upon the plains, and thinking
it was a superior breed of buffalo, determined to capture it,
so that he could take the first prize at the Kickapoo agricultural
fair. He tied his lasso to his waist and threw the other end over
the smoke-stack. The locomotive did not stop; but when the engineer
arrived at the next station, he went out and cut the string
by which a small bit of copper-colored meat was tied to his
smoke-stack. This is to illustrate the folly of the attempt of
conservatism to check the onward career of pure and enlightened
liberalism toward perfect civilization, etc., etc.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_370">[Pg 370]</a></p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus372a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>4. Arguments, and then the anecdote of that Dutchman in
Berks county, Pa., who on the 10th of October, 1866, was observed
to go out into his yard and raise the American flag; then he got his
gun and fired a salute seventeen or eighteen
times, after which he consumed six packs
of fire-crackers and gave three cheers for
the Union. He enjoyed himself in this
manner nearly all day, while his neighbors
gathered around outside and placed their
elbows upon the fence, watching him and
wondering what on earth he meant. A
peddler who came along stopped and had an
interview with him. To his surprise, he
found that the German agriculturist was
celebrating the Fourth of July, 1859. He did not know that it
was any later in the century, for he had been keeping his time
on a notched stick; and having been sick a great deal, he had
gotten the thing in a dreadful tangle. When he learned that
he was seven Fourths in arrears, he was depressed; but he sent
out and bought a box of fire-crackers and a barrel of gunpowder,
and spent a week catching up.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<img src="images/illus372b.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>(Tell this vivaciously, and make
the point that none but a member
of the other party could forget the
glorious anniversary of our country's
birth, and say that the whole
party will have to do up a lot of
back patriotism some day, if it
desires to catch up with the people
whose devotion to the country is
encouraged and kept active by our
side.)</p>

<p>5. Arguments, supplemented
with the narrative of a confiding
man who had such child-like faith
in a patent fire-extinguisher which
he had purchased that he set fire
to his house merely to have the fun of putting it out. The
<a class="pagenum" id="page_371">[Pg 371]</a>
fire burned furiously, but the extinguisher gave only two or
three imbecile squirts and then collapsed, and in two hours
his residence was in ashes. Go on to say that our enemies
have applied the torch of anarchy to the edifice of this government,
but that there is an extinguisher which will not only
<i>not</i> collapse, but will subdue the flames and quench the incendiary
organization, and that extinguisher is our party. (Allow
time for applause here.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus373.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>6. Arguments, introducing the story of the Sussex county
farmer who was discouraged because his wife was perfidious.
Before he was married she vowed over and over again that she
could chop four cords of wood a day, but after the ceremony the
farmer found he was deceived. The treacherous woman could
not chop more than two cords and a half, and so the dream of
the husband was dissipated, and he demanded a divorce as the
only balm for the wounds which lacerated his heart. Let this
serve to illustrate the point that our political enemies have deceived
us with promises to reduce the debt, to institute reforms,
etc., etc., none of which they have kept, and now we must have
<a class="pagenum" id="page_372">[Pg 372]</a>
the government separated from them by such a divorce as will
be decreed to-morrow, etc., etc.</p>

<p>7. Peroration, working in if possible the story of Commodore
Scudder's dog, which, while out with its master one day, pointed
at some partridges. The commodore was about to fire, but he
suddenly received orders to go off on a three years' cruise, so he
dropped his gun, left the dog standing there and went right to
sea. When he returned, three years later, he went back to the
field, and there was his gun, there was the skeleton of the dog
still standing and pointing just as he had left it, and a little
farther on were the skeletons of the partridges. Show how our
adversaries in their relations to the negro question resemble that
dog. We came away years ago and left them pointing at the
negro question, and we come back now to find that they are at
it yet. Work this in carefully, and conclude in such a manner
as to excite frantic applause.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was not much of a speech, I know. Some of the arguments
were weak, and several of the stories failed to fit into
their places comfortably. But mass meetings do not criticise
closely, and I was persuaded I should make a good impression,
provoking laughter and perhaps exciting enthusiasm.
The only time that could be procured for study of the speech
was that consumed by the journey. So when the train
started I took my notes from my pocket and learned them
by heart. Then came the task of enlarging them, in my
mind, into a speech. This was accomplished satisfactorily.
I suppose that speech was repeated at least ten times between
New Castle and Dover until at last I had it at my
tongue's end. In the cars the seat next to mine was occupied
by a colored gentleman, who seemed to be a little nervous
when he perceived that I was muttering something continually;
and he was actually alarmed once or twice when in
exciting passages I would forget myself and gesticulate
violently in his direction. Finally, when I came to the conclusion
and was repeating to myself the exhortation, "Strike
<a class="pagenum" id="page_373">[Pg 373]</a>
for your altars and your fires," etc., etc., I emphasized the
language by striking fiercely at the floor with the ferule of
my umbrella. It hit something soft. I think it was the
corn of my colored friend, for he leaped up hurriedly, and
ejaculating "Gosh!" went up and stood by the water-cooler
during the rest of the journey, looking at me as if he thought
it was dangerous for such a maniac to be at large.</p>

<p>When the train arrived at Dover, I was gratified to find
the chairman of the local committee and eighteen of his fellow-citizens
waiting for me with carriages and a brass band.
As I stepped from the car the band played "See, the Conquering
Hero comes!" I marched into the waiting-room
of the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t, followed by the committee and the band. The
chairman and his friends formed a semi-circle and stared at
me. I learned afterward that they had received information
from Wilmington that I was one of the most remarkable
orators in the State. It was impossible not to perceive that
they regarded me already with enthusiastic admiration; and
my heart sank a little as I reflected upon the possibility of
failure.</p>

</div>

<p>Then the music ceased, and the chairman proposed "three
cheers for our eloquent visitor." The devoted beings around
him cheered lustily. The chairman thereupon came forward
and welcomed me in the following terms:</p>

<p>"My dear sir, it is with unfeigned satisfaction that I have&mdash;may
I say the exalted honor?&mdash;of welcoming you to the
city of Dover. You come, sir, at a moment when the heart
of every true patriot beats high with hope for a glorious
<a class="pagenum" id="page_374">[Pg 374]</a>
triumph over the enemies of our cherished institutions; you
come, sir, at a time when our great party, the true representative
of American principles and the guardian of our
liberties, bends to grapple with the deadly foe of our country;
at a time, sir, when the American eagle&mdash;proud bird, which
soars, as we would, to the sun&mdash;screams forth its defiance of
treason, and when the banner of the free, the glorious emblem
of our nationality, waves us onward to victory; you come,
sir, to animate with your eloquence the hearts of our fellow-citizens;
to inspire with your glowing language the souls of
those who shrink from performing their duty in this contest;
to depict in words of burning, scathing power the shame, the
disgrace, the irretrievable ruin, which will befall our land if
its enemies are victorious, and to hold up those enemies, as
you well know how, to the scorn and contempt of all honest
men. We give you a hearty welcome, then, and assure you
that Dover will respond nobly to your appeal, giving to-morrow
such a vote for justice, truth and the rights of man
that the conservative wolf will shrink back in dismay to his
lair. Welcome, sir, thrice welcome, to our city!"</p>

<p>I stood looking at this man throughout his speech with a
conviction, constantly growing stronger, that I should be
obliged to reply to him at some length. The contemplation
of such a thing, I need hardly say, filled me with horror. I
had never made a speech of the kind that would be required
in my life, and I felt positively certain that I could not accomplish
the task now. I had half a mind to hurl at the
heads of this chairman and his attendant fiends the entire
oration prepared for the evening; but that seemed so dreadfully
inappropriate that the idea was abandoned. And besides,
what would I say at the mass meeting? The comfort
of the situation was not, by any means, improved by the fact
that these persons entertained the belief that I was an experienced
speaker who would probably throw off a dozen
<a class="pagenum" id="page_375">[Pg 375]</a>
brilliant things in as many sentences. It was exceedingly
embarrassing; and when the chairman concluded his remarks,
the cold perspiration stood upon my forehead and my
knees trembled.</p>

<p>Happily, the leader of the band desired to make himself
conspicuous, so he embraced the opportunity afforded by the
pause to give us some startling variations of "The Star-Spangled
Banner."</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus377.jpg" width="100%"

</div>

<p>As we stood there listening to the music, I observed that
the energetic gentleman who played upon the drum and
cymbals was looking at me with what seemed to be a scornful
smile. He had a peculiarly cold eye, and
as he fixed it upon me I felt that the frigid
optic pierced through and through my assumption
of ease and perceived what a miserable
sham it was for me to stand there pretending
to be an orator. I quailed before
that eye. Its glance humiliated me; and I
did not feel more pleasantly when, as the
band dashed into the final quavers which bring up suggestions
of "the land of the free and the home of the brave,"
I saw the scorn which erst flashed from that eye change to
a look of wild exultation. The cymbal man knew that my
hour had come. He gave a final clash with his brasses and
paused. I had to begin. Bowing to the chairman, I said,</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman and fellow-citizens, there are times&mdash;times&mdash;there
are times, fellow-citizens, when&mdash;times when&mdash;when
the heart&mdash;there are times, I say, Mr. Chairman and fellow-citizens,
when the heart&mdash;the heart of&mdash;of&mdash;" It wouldn't do.
I stuck fast, and could not get out another word.</p>

<p>The cold-eyed man seemed ready to play triumphal strains
upon his drum and to smash out a p&aelig;an upon his cymbals.
In the frenzy and desperation of the moment, I determined
to take the poetry from my exordium and to jam it into the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_376">[Pg 376]</a>
present speech, whether it was appropriate or not. I began
again:</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
<img src="images/illus378.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"There are times, I say, fellow-citizens and Mr. Chairman,
when the heart inquires if there breathes a man with
soul so dead, who never to himself hath said, 'This is my
own, my native land'&mdash;whose heart has ne'er within him
burned as home his footsteps he
hath turned from wanderings
on a foreign shore? If such
there breathe, go, mark him
well!" (Here I pointed to the
street, and one of the committee,
who seemed not to
comprehend the thing exactly,
rushed to the window and
looked out, as if he intended
to call a policeman to arrest
the wretch referred to.) "For
him no minstrel raptures
swell." (Here the leader of the
band bowed, as if he had a vague idea that this was a compliment
ingeniously worked into the speech for his benefit;
but the cold-eyed man had a sneering smile which seemed to
say, "It won't do, my man, it won't do. I can't be bought
off in that manner.") "High though his titles, proud his
name, boundless his wealth as wish can claim; despite these
titles, power and pelf, the wretch, concentred all in self,
living, shall forfeit fair renown, and doubly dying shall go
down to the vile dust from whence he sprung, unwept, unhonored
and unsung."</p>

<p>I stopped. There was embarrassing silence for a moment,
as if everybody thought I had something more to say. But
I put on my hat and shouldered my umbrella to assure them
that the affair was ended. Then it began to be apparent
<a class="pagenum" id="page_377">[Pg 377]</a>
that the company failed to grasp the purpose of my remarks.
One man evidently thought I was complaining of something
that happened to me while I was upon the train, for he took
me aside and asked me in a confidential whisper if it wouldn't
be better for him to see the conductor about it.</p>

<p>Another man inquired if the governor was the man referred
to.</p>

<p>I said, "No; the remarks were of a poetical nature; they
were quoted."</p>

<p>The man seemed surprised, and asked where I got them
from.</p>

<p>"From <i>Marmion</i>."</p>

<p>He considered a moment, and then said,</p>

<p>"Don't know him. Philadelphia man, I reckon?"</p>

<p>The occasion was too sad for words. I took the chairman's
arm and we marched out to the carriages, the cold-eyed
man thumping his drum as if his feeling of animosity
for me would kill him if it did not find vigorous expression
of that kind.</p>

<p>We entered the carriages and formed a procession, the
band, on foot, leading the way and playing "Hail to the
Chief." I rode with the chairman, who insisted that I should
carry the American flag in my hand. As we passed up the
street the crowd cheered us vehemently several times, and the
chairman said he thought it would be better if I would rise
occasionally and bow in response. I did so, remarking, at
the last, that it was rather singular such a reception should
be given to a complete stranger.</p>

<p>The chairman said he had been thinking of that, and it
had occurred to him just at that moment that perhaps the
populace had mistaken the character of the parade.</p>

<p>"You see," said he, "there is a circus in town, and I am
a little bit afraid the people are impressed with the idea
that this is the showman's procession, and that you are the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_378">[Pg 378]</a>
A&euml;rial King. That monarch is a man of about your build,
and he wears whiskers."</p>

<p>The A&euml;rial King achieved distinction and a throne by
leaping into the air and turning two backward somersaults
before alighting, and also by standing poised upon one toe
on a wire while he balanced a pole upon his nose. I had no
desire to share the sceptre with that man, or to rob him of
any of his renown, so I furled the flag of my beloved country,
pulled my hat over my eyes and refused to bow again.</p>

<p>It was supper-time when we reached the hotel, and as
soon as we entered, the chairman invited us into one of the
parlors, where an elaborate repast had been prepared for
the whole party. We went into the room, keeping step
with a march played by the band, which was placed in the
corner. When supper was over, it was with dismay that I
saw the irrepressible chairman rise and propose a toast, to
which he called upon one of the company to respond. I
knew my turn would come presently, and there seemed to
be no choice between the sacrifice of my great speech to this
paltry occasion and utter ruin and disgrace. It appeared
to me that the chairman must have guessed that I had but
one speech, and that he had determined to force me to
deliver it prematurely, so that I might be overwhelmed with
mortification at the mass meeting. But I made up my
mind to cling desperately to the solitary oration, no matter
how much pressure was brought to bear to deprive me of it.
So I resolved that if the chairman called upon me I would
tell my number two story, giving the arguments, and omitting
all of it from my speech in the evening.</p>

<p>He did call. When two or three men had spoken, the
chairman offered the toast, "The orator of the evening," and
it was received with applause. The chairman said: "It is
with peculiar pleasure that I offer this sentiment. It gives
to my eloquent young friend an opportunity which could
<a class="pagenum" id="page_379">[Pg 379]</a>
not be obtained amid the embarrassments of the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t to
offer, without restraint, such an exhibition of his powers as
would prove to the company that the art which enabled
Webster and Clay to win the admiration of an entranced
world was not lost&mdash;that it found a master interpreter in the
gentleman who sits before me."</p>

<p>This was severe. The cold-eyed child of the Muses sitting
with the band looked as if he felt really and thoroughly
glad in the inmost recesses of his soul for the first time in
his life.</p>

<div class="figright w50">
<img src="images/illus381.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>I rose, and said: "Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I am
too much fatigued to make a speech, and I wish to save my
voice for to-night; so I will tell you a story of a man I used
to know whose name was Hotchkiss. He lived up at New
Castle, and one night he thought he would have a little
innocent fun scaring his wife by dropping a loose brick or
two down the chimney into the fireplace in her room. So
he slipped softly out of bed; and dressed in his night-shirt,
he stole up stairs and crept out upon the roof. Mr. Hotchkiss
dropped nineteen
bricks down that chimney,
Mr. Chairman and
gentlemen, each one
with an emphatic slam,
but his wife didn't
scream once."</p>

<p>Everybody seemed to think this was the end
of the story; so there was a roar of laughter,
although I had not reached the humorous
part or the real point of the anecdote, which
<a class="pagenum" id="page_380">[Pg 380]</a>
describes how Hotchkiss gave it up and tried to go down
stairs, but was surprised to find that Mrs. Hotchkiss, who
had been watching all the time, had retreated fastening the
trap-door, so that he spent the next four hours upon the comb
of the roof with his trailing garments of the night fluttering
in the evening breeze. But they all laughed and began
to talk; and the leader of the band, considering that his
turn must have come, struck out into "Hail Columbia,"
while the man with the cymbals seemed animated with fiendish
glee.</p>

<p>I tried to explain to the chairman that it was all wrong,
that the affair was terribly mixed.</p>

<p>He said he thought himself that it seemed so somehow,
and he offered to explain the matter to the company and
to give me a chance to tell the story over again properly.</p>

<p>I intimated, gloomily, that if he undertook such a thing
I would blow out his brains with the very first horse-pistol
I could lay my hands upon.</p>

<p>He said perhaps, then, it would be better not to do.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The proceedings at the mass meeting were to begin at
eight o'clock. At half-past seven I went to the telegraph
office, and sent the following despatch to the Wilmington
papers, fearing the office might be closed when the meeting
adjourned:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">"Dover</span>, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;, 18&mdash;: A tremendous mass meeting was
held here to-night. The utmost enthusiasm was displayed
by the crowd. Effective speeches were made by several
prominent gentlemen, among them the eloquent young
orator Mr. Max Adeler, whose spirited remarks, interspersed
with sparkling anecdote, provoked uproarious applause.
Dover is good for five hundred majority, and perhaps
a thousand."</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_381">[Pg 381]</a></p>

<p>At eight o'clock a very large crowd really did assemble
in front of the porch of one of the hotels. The speakers
were placed upon the balcony, which was but a few feet
above the pavement, and there was also a number of persons
connected with the various political clubs of the town.
I felt somewhat nervous; but I was tolerably certain I could
speak my piece acceptably, even with the poetry torn out of
the introduction and the number two story sacrificed. I
took a seat upon the porch and waited while the band
played a spirited air or two. It grieved me to perceive that
the band stood directly in front of us upon
the pavement, the cold-eyed drummer occupying
a favorable position for staring at me.</p>

<div class="figright w10">
<img src="images/illus383.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>The chairman began with a short speech
in which he went over almost precisely the
ground covered by my introduction; and as
that portion of my oration was already reduced
to a fragment by the use of the verses,
I quietly resolved to begin, when my turn
came, with point number two.</p>

<p>The chairman introduced to the crowd Mr. Keyser, who
was received with cheers. He was a ready speaker, and he
began, to my deep regret, by telling in capital style my
story number three, after which he used up some of my
number six arguments, and concluded with the remark that
it was not his purpose to occupy the attention of the meeting
for any length of time, because the executive committee in
Wilmington had sent an eloquent orator who was now upon
the platform and would present the cause of the party in a
manner which he could not hope to approach.</p>

<p>Mr. Keyser then sat down, and Mr. Schwartz was introduced.
Mr. Schwartz observed that it was hardly worth
while for him to attempt to make anything like a speech,
because the gentleman from New Castle had come down on
<a class="pagenum" id="page_382">[Pg 382]</a>
purpose to discuss the issues of the campaign, and the audience,
of course, was anxious to hear him. Mr. Schwartz
would only tell a little story which seemed to illustrate a
point he wished to make, and he thereupon related my anecdote
number seven, making it appear that he was the bosom
friend of Commodore Scudder and an acquaintance of the
man who made the gun. The point illustrated I was
shocked to find was almost precisely that which I had attached
to my story number seven. The situation began to
have a serious appearance. Here, at one fell swoop, two of
my best stories and three of my sets of arguments were swept
off into utter uselessness.</p>

<p>When Schwartz withdrew, a man named Krumbauer was
brought forward. Krumbauer was a German, and the
chairman announced that he would speak in that language
for the benefit of those persons in the audience to whom the
tongue was pleasantly familiar. Krumbauer went ahead,
and the crowd received his remarks with roars of laughter.
After one particularly exuberant outburst of merriment, I
asked the man who sat next to me, and who seemed deeply
interested in the story,</p>

<p>"What was that little joke of Krumbauer's? It must
have been first rate."</p>

<p>"So it was," he said. "It was about a Dutchman up in
Berks county, Penna., who got mixed up in his dates."</p>

<p>"What dates?" I gasped, in awful apprehension.</p>

<p>"Why, his Fourths of July, you know. Got seven or eight
years in arrears and tried to make them all up at once.
Good, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Good? I should think so; ha! ha! My very best
story, as I'm a sinner!"</p>

<p>It was awfully bad. I could have strangled Krumbauer
and then chopped him into bits. The ground seemed slipping
away beneath me; there was the merest skeleton of a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_383">[Pg 383]</a>
speech left. But I determined to take that and do my best,
trusting to luck for a happy result.</p>

<p>But my turn had not yet come. Mr. Wilson was dragged
out next, and I thought I perceived a demoniac smile steal
over the countenance of the cymbal player as Wilson said
he was too hoarse to say much; he would leave the heavy
work for the brilliant young orator who was here from New
Castle. He would skim rapidly over the ground and then
retire. He did. Wilson rapidly skimmed all the cream off
of my arguments numbers two, five and six, and wound up
by offering the whole of my number four argument. My
hair fairly stood on end when Wilson bowed and left the
stand. What on earth was I to do now? Not an argument
left to stand upon; all my anecdotes gone but two, and my
mind in such a condition of frenzied bewilderment that it
seemed as if there was not another available argument or
suggestion or hint or anecdote remaining in the entire universe.
In an agony of despair, I turned to the man next to
me and asked him if I would have to follow Wilson.</p>

<p>He said it was his turn now.</p>

<p>"And what are you going to say?" I demanded, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," he replied&mdash;"nothing at all. I want to
leave room for you. I'll just tell a little story or so, to
amuse them, and then sit down."</p>

<p>"What story, for instance?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, nothing; only a little yarn I happen to remember
about a farmer who married a woman who said she
could cut four cords of wood, when she couldn't."</p>

<p>My worst fears were realized. I turned to the man next
to me, and said, with suppressed emotion,</p>

<p>"May I ask your name, my friend?"</p>

<p>He said his name was Gumbs.</p>

<p>"May I inquire what your Christian name is?"</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_384">[Pg 384]</a></p>

<p>He said it was William Henry.</p>

<p>"Well, William Henry Gumbs," I exclaimed, "gaze at
me! Do I look like a man who would slay a human being
in cold blood?"</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m, n-no; you don't," he replied, with an air of
critical consideration.</p>

<p>"But I AM!" said I, fiercely&mdash;"I AM; and I tell you
now that if you undertake to relate that anecdote about the
farmer's wife I will blow you into eternity without a moment's
warning; I will, by George!"</p>

<p>Mr. Gumbs instantly jumped up, placed his hand on the
railing of the porch, and got over suddenly into the crowd.
He stood there pointing me out to the bystanders, and
doubtless advancing the theory that I was an original kind
of a lunatic, who might be expected to have at any moment
a fit which would be interesting when studied from a distance.</p>

<p>The chairman looked around, intending to call upon my
friend Mr. Gumbs; but not perceiving him, he came to me
and said:</p>

<p>"Now is your chance, sir; splendid opportunity; crowd
worked up to just the proper pitch. We have paved the
way for you; go in and do your best."</p>

<p>"Oh yes; but hold on for a few moments, will you? I
can't speak now; the fact is I am not quite ready. Run out
some other man."</p>

<p>"Haven't got another man. Kept you for the last purposely,
and the crowd is waiting. Come ahead and pitch in,
and give it to 'em hot and heavy."</p>

<p>It was very easy for him to say "give it to them," but I
had nothing to give. Beautifully they paved the way for
me! Nicely they had worked up the crowd to the proper
pitch! Here I was in a condition of frantic despair, with a
crowd of one thousand people expecting a brilliant oration
<a class="pagenum" id="page_385">[Pg 385]</a>
from me who had not a thing in my mind but a beggarly
story about a fire-extinguisher and a worse one about a
farmer's wife. I groaned in spirit and wished I had been
born far away in some distant clime among savages who
knew not of mass meetings, and whose language contained
such a small number of words that speech-making was impossible.</p>

<p>But the chairman was determined. He seized me by the
arm and fairly dragged me to the front. He introduced me
to the crowd in flattering, and I may say outrageously ridiculous,
terms, and then whispering in my ear, "Hit 'em hard,
old fellow, hit 'em hard," he sat down.</p>

<p>The crowd received me with three hearty cheers. As I
heard them I began to feel dizzy. The audience seemed to
swim around and to increase tenfold in size. By a resolute
effort I recovered my self-possession partially, and determined
to begin. I could not think of anything but the two stories,
and I resolved to tell them as well as I could. I said,</p>

<p>"Fellow-citizens: It is so late now that I will not attempt
to make a speech to you." (Cries of "Yes!" "Go ahead!"
"Never mind the time!" etc., etc.) Elevating my voice, I
repeated: "I say it is so late now that I can't make a speech
as I intended on account of its being so late that the speech
which I intended to make would keep you here too late if I
made it as I intended to. So I will tell you a story about a
man who bought a patent fire-extinguisher which was warranted
to split four cords of wood a day; so he set fire to his
house to try her, and&mdash; No, it was his wife who was warranted
to split four cords of wood&mdash;I got it wrong; and when
the flames obtained full headway, he found she could only
split two cords and a half, and it made him&mdash; What I
mean is that the farmer, when he bought the exting&mdash;and
courted her, that is, she said she could set fire to the house,
when he tried her, she collapsed the first time&mdash;the extinguisher
<a class="pagenum" id="page_386">[Pg 386]</a>
did, and he wanted a divorce because his hous&mdash;h,
hang it, fellow-citizens, you understand that this man, or
farmer, rather, bought a&mdash;I should say courted a&mdash;that is, a
fire-ex&mdash;" (Desperately.) "Fellow-citizens! <span class="smcap">If any man
shoots the American flag, pull him down upon the
spot; but as for me, give me liberty or give me
death!</span>"</p>

<p>As I shouted this out at the top of my voice, in an ecstasy
of confusion, a wild, tumultuous
yell of laughter
came up from the
crowd. I paused for a
second beneath the spell
of that cold eye in the
band, and then, dashing
through the throng
at the back of the porch,
I rushed down the street
to the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t, with the
shouts of the crowd and
the uproarious music of
the band ringing in my
ears. I got upon a
freight train, gave the
engineer five dollars to take me along on the locomotive, and
spent the night riding to New Castle.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the day of
the wedding.</p>

<p>I suppose no one can hope
to describe accurately the
sensation that is created by
such an event in a little community
like ours. It has
supplied the ladies of the village
with material for discussion
for several weeks past,
and the extraordinary interest
manifested in it has constantly
grown stronger until
it culminated in a blaze of
excitement which made calmness upon the part of any New
Castilian upon the great day a wholly impossible condition.
My own wife has introduced the subject in her conversation
with me at every available opportunity; and when I have
grown weary of hearing about the preparations for the wedding,
about the purchases made by the Magruders for Bessie,
about the presents given to the bride by her friends, about the
future prospects of the pair, and about other matrimonial
<a class="pagenum" id="page_388">[Pg 388]</a>
things innumerable, the excellent partner of my joys, still
with unabated enthusiasm, has turned from so dull a listener,
and seizing her bonnet and shawl, has darted off to visit Mrs.
Jones or Mrs. Hopkins, and has found them eager to participate
in conversation upon these subjects. During the past
month this sympathetic woman has called at Magruder's at
least three times a day to ascertain the latest facts respecting
the situation, and to give advice and assistance to the busy
workers who have been preparing the multitude of articles
which a girl must have before she is married. Every woman
in the village was familiar, long ago, with the minutest
details of the arrangements, and all of them were so deeply
absorbed in the preparations and in contemplation of the
approaching catastrophe that they cared for nothing else.
If there had been revolutions, if thrones had tottered to their
fall, if hurricanes had swept over the land and the nations
had been stricken by the scourge, I verily believe that these
devoted women of New Castle would have regarded these
calamities with steadfast composure, and would have excluded
them from a place in the social debates wherein the wedding
of Bessie Magruder was the one great subject of discussion.</p>

<p>There is nothing more intense in nature than the interest
felt by a woman in the marriage of another woman. The
fanatic fury of a Hindoo devotee is mere icy indifference in
comparison to it.</p>

<p>It was entertaining to watch Bob Parker upon the evening
before the wedding and upon the morning of the great
day itself. He had everything ready a week before the
time, and upon the last night of his bachelor life he had
nothing to do but to sit at home with us and think. And
so, while I read my book and while Mrs. Adeler finished the
bonnet that she had made for the occasion from old material
(the dexterous economy of that woman, by the way, is simply
phenomenal), Bob fidgeted about. He pretended to read the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_389">[Pg 389]</a>
paper; he threw himself upon the lounge and counterfeited
sleep; he darted suddenly up stairs to see if he had put a
sufficient number of collars in his trunk; he darted down
again and tried on his new hat for the fiftieth time; he stood
by the fire and expressed his fear, often repeated during the
day, that there would be rain on the morrow; he tried to
wind up his watch four times, and he examined his pocket-book
over and over again to ascertain if the ring was safe.
At a ridiculously early hour he said he was tired and must
go to bed; but when I ascended the stairs about midnight,
I could hear him still moving about. He was nervous, excited
and anxious.</p>

<div class="figcenter w50">

</div>

<p>Before daylight dawned Bob was out of bed and down
stairs smoking and guessing at the weather. When we descended,
he was in extreme agitation lest the man should not
come with the bouquets. When the flowers did arrive, they
looked so much like business that he immediately flew up to
his room and put on his wedding suit.</p>

<div class="figleft w10">
<img src="images/illus392a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>Then we had to wait nearly two hours for the carriages,
and Bob was harassed by doubts as to the correctness of the
appearance of his neck-tie. Three times Mrs. Adeler applied
thread and needle to that article of adornment, and at
<a class="pagenum" id="page_390">[Pg 390]</a>
last Bob threw it away and assumed another. He seemed
to have a strong conviction that the eyes of the entire assembly
would be concentrated upon that white tie. Then he
put on his gloves and sat, flushed and uncomfortable in his
new clothing, waiting for the moment of his departure. Presently
he discovered that he had lost one of his
gold shirt buttons; and after a very long and
very warm search for it, he thought he felt it in
his boot. I procured a boot-jack for him; and
when the button was found, he had to remove
his gloves again in order to pull his boot on.
He was beginning to be acutely miserable when,
at last, the carriages arrived. Then Mrs. Adeler
came down; and when I had buttoned her
gloves with a hair-pin and criticised the appearance
of her dress, we went out to the street and drove away.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus392b.jpg" width="100%"

</div>

<p>When we reached Magruder's, the doorway was surrounded
by quite a throng of persons. The excitement had reached
even the lower classes, and a crowd composed of slatternly
women with babies in their arms, of truant servant-girls, of
unclean children, of idle men and noisy boys, stood upon the
pavement waiting for the bride to come out. As we descended
from the carriages, Bob was the chief object of
interest, and while the women eyed him with admiration the
boys made very unpleasant remarks concerning his clothing,
particularly his "claw-hammer coat," When we entered
the house, Bob ascended to some mysterious region above to
wait for Bessie, while we examined the bridal gifts and conversed
<a class="pagenum" id="page_391">[Pg 391]</a>
with the paternal Magruder, who was plainly uncomfortable
in his wedding garments.</p>

<p>Then the bride descended amid exclamations of admiration
from the servants and their friends, who were collected
in a knot at the rear of the hall. She did look very sweet
and pretty, that little maiden, in her lovely white dress, with
orange blossoms in her dark hair, with a radiant light in her
brown eyes and with a faint glow warming her cheek. Bob
Parker had good reason to feel proud as he led the fair girl
to the altar; and he was proud, despite his trepidation.</p>

<p>And when our salutations were over, when the satins and
silks were all arranged and the bridesmaids and groomsmen
were ready, we marched through the critical assembly outside
the door and drove swiftly to the church. At the gate
we found, awaiting the wedding party, another throng of
spectators, among them that gloomy undertaker, with his
chin hooked upon the wall, and his mind still brooding
over his wrongs.</p>

<p>Then we heard the organ playing the Coronation March,
and as the bridal party entered the church and swept up the
aisle the Wedding March burst forth. There was a fluttering
and a turning of heads in the pews; then silence, and
then the ceremony began. Bob was pale as a ghost, and
his replies could hardly be heard, but Bessie spoke with
perfect distinctness. It is strange that women on these occasions
should always be more composed than men.</p>

<p>And when the solemn words were said, Bob kissed his
wife gallantly, and then, as the organ uttered Mendelssohn's
lovely melody "I waited for the Lord," the two turned
about and in the aisle met hosts of friends eager to congratulate
them. At any other time Bob might have been mortified
that he was a person of secondary importance. It was
the bride that the people looked at, and not the groom.
But now he was too happy and too ready to forget himself.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_392">[Pg 392]</a>
He was too glad to have his wife greeted warmly to think
of any other thing. By the time the church porch was
reached every woman present had the details of Bessie's
costume fixed indelibly in her mind, ready for description
and explanation to her friends; and while the bell in the
steeple rang out a merry peal, we returned to the Magruder
mansion, where, in the company of friends, we passed the
few hours before the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Parker.</p>

<p>Rev. Dr. Hopkins was there, beaming at the guests through
his gold spectacles, and making himself very comfortable
with the oysters and terrapin and chicken salad. He even
had a smile for Colonel Bangs, who was discussing with Mr.
Magruder the probable effect upon the railway interests of
the country of an article in the <i>Argus</i> of that morning upon
"Our Grinding Monopolies." It was interesting to listen to
the colonel.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus394.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"I tell you," said he, with vehemence, "the time has come
<a class="pagenum" id="page_393">[Pg 393]</a>
for the overthrow of these gigantic railroad corporations;
the time has come for a free press to open its batteries upon
the monopolies which are trampling the rights of the people
beneath their feet. There will be a bitter fight, sir, mark
me; it will be a battle to the death. But the <i>Argus</i> enters
the lists boldly and without fear. The article of to-day unsheaths
the sword; it warns the railway tyrants that the
battle has begun."</p>

<p>"I am sure it will alarm them," said Mr. Magruder.
"And you, I suppose, are willing to give up everything
for the cause? How about your annual free pass to Philadelphia?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ah! as for that," exclaimed the colonel, "you perhaps
observed that I expressly excepted our own road and
complimented its officers. A man must not go to extremes
in these matters, Magruder. And then there's the advertising,
you know! No, sir; we must proceed, as it were,
cautiously at first. Precipitate action might ruin everything."</p>

<p>Dr. Tobias Jones also had overcome his professional animosity
to Mrs. Magruder, and he was not only present, but
he was conversing pleasantly with that lady, probably upon
the subjects of bilious fever and aneurisms. Benjamin P.
Gunn was there, bustling around among the guests and paying
especial attention to Bob. When I saw Gunn in earnest
conversation with the groom and caught the words, "in favor
of your wife, you know," I became aware of the fact that
Benjamin was improving the festive hour with an attempt
to do a bit of business. Even Judge Pitman was present,
for Mr. Magruder liked the old man and was in a gracious
mood upon that day. I welcomed the judge heartily when,
dressed in a swallow-tail coat of a surprising pattern, he
came up to me and said,</p>

<p>"Splendid send-off for them young folks, ain't it? I tell
<a class="pagenum" id="page_394">[Pg 394]</a>
you, they didn't do things this way when me an' Harriet
consolidated! We lived down yer in Kent; an' when we
were married by the squire, I give him fifty cents an' then
went out an' borrowed a
waggin so's me an' Harriet
could take a little drive.
We come up yer to New
Cassel an' stayed two days
at the tavern, an' then
drove back an' begun
work agin, jes' 's if nothin'
oncommon had happened."</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illus396a.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Illustration"

</div>

<p>"It was not the custom then, I suppose, to make a display on such occasions?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>sir</i>! People hadn't
no money to git up sich
fodderin' as this yer. They
had to go slower. Still,"
mused the judge, "it's all right&mdash;it's all right. Gittin' married's
a big event; an' if you kin make a fuss over it, you
ought to. If my daughter ever tries it, I'll give her the
best I kin buy. A weddin' like this is nice all 'round, but
the wimmen in partickler is amazin' fond of sich things.
If you'll excuse me, I believe I'll try another fried oyster."</p>

<div class="figright w10">

</div>

<p>There was another exciting time when Bessie, at last,
came down in her traveling dress and stood with Bob ready
to depart. While the cabman carried the trunks to the carriage,
Bessie said her farewells. There was a good-bye for
mother, uttered with tears in the eyes of both
of them, a tender adieu to father, kisses for the
women and a shake of the hand for the men, and
then they entered the carriage. We flung an
old shoe or two after them and waved our hands; and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_395">[Pg 395]</a>
Cooley's boy gave them a parting salute with a stone that
shivered the carriage window. We watched them as they
went down the street, and saw, now and then, a handkerchief
fluttered toward us; then they turned a corner and
disappeared.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a little lonely in the cottage upon that evening with
Bob no longer a member of the family. We shall miss him,
with his sprightliness and fun; and we shall half incline to
regret that the little drama we have watched so long with
eager interest is ended, even though the prince, after all his
suffering, has found the princess and wedded her, and though
at last they have gone "across the hills and far away" beyond
"the utmost purple rim of that new world, which is
the old."</p>

<p>We sat in the old room in silence for a while, both looking
at the fire and both thinking, not so much of the events
of the day as of the promise of the future for those two
voyagers into the golden regions of delight. Then Mrs.
Adeler said, with half a sigh:</p>

<p>"I do hope they will be happy!"</p>

<p>"And so do I; and I really believe they will be, for both
of them have sweet tempers and good common sense; those
are the qualities that are likely to ensure the felicity of married
folks."</p>

<p>"But it is a great risk for Bob to run; and for Bessie too,
for that matter."</p>

<p>"So it is; but it is a risk that may fairly be taken when
the judgment gives approval to the choice of the heart.
Lovers do not bother themselves, however, a great deal with
the possibilities of the future. They have only sunshine now,
and it seems as if so clear a sky could never breed cloud and
storm. It is a happy thing for them, as well as for the rest
of us, that no human ingenuity can lift the veil that shuts
<a class="pagenum" id="page_396">[Pg 396]</a>
from our eyes the mysteries of the years to come. Think
what a journey it is that began to-day! Separate and apart
they have come thus far; but now they are to travel during
all their lives together, over rough places as well as where
the way is smooth. The power of each over the happiness
of the other is infinite. He can make her wholly miserable,
and she can utterly destroy his peace. A violent demonstration
is not required. A little indifference at first, a
harsh word, then a growing coldness, then neglect, and for
ever afterward complete separation of heart and soul and
feeling, though outwardly they seem united.</p>

<p>"And even if they should be as happy as the most blessed
of us, it is well that their imaginations should throw about
the future a glamour which will hide the reality. A tried
and well-proved love will hardly bear the shock when misfortune
and poverty come; it sometimes permits an almost
fatal display of ill-temper when there are sleepless nights
with sick and peevish children, when the soul is vexed with
the cares of business, with the smaller trials of life, and with
the myriad petty annoyances that are encountered in the
path of every man. There are few of us who are heroes
among the troubles of common life. Perhaps we bear the
heavy blows courageously enough; but we cry out when we
are stung by the pigmy arrows that are shot at us every day,
at home and in the world. The truly great man is he who
is patient and forbearing beneath small vexations. The
real hero is he who bears the burden of his life, with its
swarm of minor troubles, with calm, sweet evenness of
temper and with steadfast courage. The peevish and the
irritable are the enemies of peace in this world. Our lad
and lass, we may hope, will find a place for themselves
among those who wisely choose the better part.</p>

<p>"And now, Mrs. Adeler, would it not be well to close our
record, as the hero and the heroine depart? It is the custom,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_397">[Pg 397]</a>
in the novel and upon the stage, to end the story when the
knight and the lady who have loved and suffered through
all the pages and all the acts are made man and wife. We
have not done much with our pair; but it is enough that we
have told a simple story of an old passion in still another
form, and that we have given the chronicles of the village
with what quality of humor we could infuse into them, but
without malice or vulgarity and without irreverence. I have
no patience with those who seek to find amusement by committing
these faults. There is matter enough in harmless
things for sportiveness; and rather than try to excite mirth
by hurting the feelings of my neighbors, by stooping to
coarseness, or by speaking with levity of things that are
sacred, I would consent to write only books that should be
as solemn as tragedy itself. We have had some strange experiences
since the record began, and we should be very dull
indeed if we had not learned something from them. Of one
thing we are completely convinced: it is that a man who is
made miserable because his neighbors will not do as he
wishes them to do had better not come to this or any
other village with the intent to be made happy. The
man who voluntarily becomes a hermit is a fool. A man
of sense must necessarily desire to live with his fellows
and to enjoy their society, their sympathy and the comforts
that can be obtained with their assistance. He can have
these only by making sacrifices for them. He must not
only give up some of his natural rights as an individual, but
he must make up his mind to endure patiently disagreeable
things that are done by his neighbors. He may flee from
the city to escape the professor of music who hammers a
piano ceaselessly, but in his new home he will certainly find
a compensating nuisance of some kind. Until all men learn
to think and act alike, he will find everywhere in the world
those who are fond of the things that he hates, and who will
<a class="pagenum" id="page_398">[Pg 398]</a>
do things that he thinks should be left undone. The man,
therefore, who comes to the village in pursuit of perfect
peace and quiet of course will not find them. He will encounter
the disagreeable practices and peculiarities of other
people precisely as he did in the city; he will be called upon
to endure annoyances as aggravating as any of those from
which he has flown. He can have comparative contentment
and repose in either place only by determining to have them
despite his neighbors. It is probable that men will always
have in this world sharp corners and rough surfaces with
which they will jag and tear each other as they roll onward
in the swift current of life. Perhaps we shall have
smoothness and evenness when we enter Paradise. I hope
so, at any rate. And meantime let us all stop growling
about evils which cannot be cured.</p>

<p>"And now I will conclude our meek little story. Perhaps
regretfully I will close the door through which the public
has been suffered to peep in upon the movements of our
quiet life at home and in the village, and thus will end the
spectacle. That life will continue, but it shall be sacred to
ourselves, and the events that give it interest shall go unrecorded."</p>
